0,So this is James Risen.,This is James 22nd.
1,You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter  for The New York Times.,You may be familiar with him because he won the New York Times column Y-axis.
2,"Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name,  Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed  that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.","Longes before anyone heard of Edward Snow, in the book he described that the Native Americans were listening to."
3,But it's another chapter in that book  that may have an even more lasting impact.,But it's another chapter that should stay behind a glimpse of it.
4,"In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation  in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints  of a nuclear bomb to Iran.","He describes an a catastrophic secret service in the U.S. Capitol, which Iran is literally a nuclear bombing disaster."
5,"If that sounds crazy, go read it.","If it sounds crazy, you read it."
6,It's an incredible story.,It's an incredible story.
7,But you know who didn't like that chapter?,But you know what chapter you didn't like?
8,The US government.,It's U.S. government.
9,"For nearly a decade afterwards,  Risen was the subject of a US government investigation  in which prosecutors demanded that he testify  against one of his alleged sources.","For 10 years, the government has spent the modern commoditized its bump and call it inverted its source."
10,"And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern  of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.","In this train, he became the symbol for the government, quill and a grueling agent in this train."
11,"You see, under the First Amendment,  the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.","First, the data is what the media has, to publish the law, is putting the information back into the intelligence."
12,But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news  and protect the identities of the brave men and women  who get it to them.,But it's impossible to apply this rights to media if the media isn't given this information and if they don't get identity of the could protect it.
13,"So when the government came knocking,  Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him:  he refused  and said he'd rather go to jail.","So when the government went to us, he did what he had done, he said, ""The government will come to jail and tell him that he'd rather go to jail."""
14,"So from 2007 to 2015,  Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.","So, from 2007 to the risk of 2015, they were living in prison."
15,"That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.","But then, just before that, something extraordinary happens."
16,"Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case,  the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.","But, however, they would have spent years largely necessary that it would have been thought that the government would have gone to drop in the country."
17,"It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance,  there are very few places reporters and sources can hide.",The electronic causes of electronic control may eat less and less dense.
18,"And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify,  they could have his digital trail testify against him instead.","Instead of shit andrineing the unexplaining of its foot, we could do that for him."
19,"So completely in secret and without his consent,  prosecutors got Risen's phone records.","And so, they have, without consent, his phone, his mindset."
20,"They got his email records, his financial and banking information,  his credit reports,  even travel records with a list of flights he had taken.","So it's just like his email, financial services, financial information, and his credit, and even this list of his list."
21,"And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,  Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.","In the middle of this information, they found evidence that they used in order to train Jeffreytrajecto, a CIA and robbery source."
22,"Sadly, this is only one case of many.","Unfortunately, that's just one case of a lot."
23,"President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers,  and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more  than all other administrations combined.","President Obama spoke at his president, Whirlwind, but instead teaches all the people that are more likely to vote against him than any USC."
24,"Now, you can see how this could be a problem,  especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.","Now you can imagine how that's a problem because in particular the government, especially in secretly, is much more secret than its work."
25,"Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security  has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.","Since September the 11th, almost everybody had been talking about national security above a journalist, that a writer was a journalist."
26,So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job  that the First Amendment is supposed to protect  because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.,"So we're putting the press work on the first to try to get rid of this by government, because it has to be spread out by the governments to debate all the."
27,"But just as technology has allowed the government  to circumvent reporters' rights,  the press can also use technology  to protect their sources even better than before.",But as well as the government of the technology allows the rights to avoid the press can also use the press to protect their sources.
28,"And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them,  rather than on the witness stand after the fact.","That's what they can do, instead of deafuse them, they're putting up contacts stuff."
29,"Communications software now exists  that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book,  and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.","Today, the communications studies have not been written yet, when there were his book, and it's essentially certain email than normalness or a phone call."
30,"For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,  an open-source whistleblower submission system  that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,  and is now developed at the non-profit where I work,  Freedom of the Press Foundation.","So, one such technology is the Openlufactur, which is the open-source version of Whirlwind system that we've gone from, developed by the Internet, and I work with, a lot of the press that I'm working on, often."
31,"Instead of sending an email,  you go to a news organization's website,  like this one here on The Washington Post.","Instead of sending an email, go to a message: get your messages to the Washington Post."
32,"From there, you can upload a document or send information  much like you would on any other contact form.",They can put documents up or send it information in every typical way that you can have.
33,It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server  that only the news organization has access to.,"And then this one is stored on a servers, which has just been access to the remote control group."
34,"So the government can no longer secretly demand the information,  and much of the information they would demand  wouldn't be available in the first place.","So government cannot create the information, and, in many of the information that it would inevitably be available."
35,"SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle  for protecting press freedom in the 21st century.","But the coverage is only a small part of the whole, but smaller the press in the 21st century."
36,"Unfortunately, governments all over the world  are constantly developing new spying techniques  that put us all at risk.","Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new technologies, which are letting us all into the world."
37,"And it's up to us going forward to make sure  that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers,  like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.","It's clear to us that it isn't just technology, as rational as Snow did any way of putting a possibility of a space on the next Whirlwind, that we will protect the next Whirt."
38,"It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower  alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,  or the next environmental worker  sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water,  or a Wall Street insider  warning us of the next financial crisis.","Over the coast of troops who wants to put on the ground and the next water, or the newest water work with the news system, or a steward of Flint, or a Wall Street firm who warns us."
39,"After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women  who expose crimes,  but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.","After all, these technologies have not been made for just the ones that want to adapt to crimes, but to protect our very self-interest."
40,Thank you.,Thank you.
41,"[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.]  [The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people]  [hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.]  [What does this mean?]  [We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]  This week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories  coming out from the leak of 11 million documents  from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.","Three Gorges Damn data released that the largest database of allies pointing out, and M.P. [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.] [P.]"
42,The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece  of the secretive offshore world.,The publication of these document is basically a small region of the secret world.
43,"We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers  go to companies like Mossack Fonseca  and say, ""OK, we want an anonymous company,  can you give us one?""","We get a sense of what clients and bankers, and legal companies like Moson and go, ""Look, we need an anonymous company. Can you have a anonymous company?"""
44,"So you actually get to see the emails,  you get to see the exchanges of messages,  you get to see the mechanics of how this works,  how this operates.","We see, in fact, the email of news all the way it works."
45,"Now, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.",This has already led to a very first consequence.
46,The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.,"Now, Prime Minister is back on prime minister."
47,We've also had news  that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad  has also got offshore companies.,The report is that there's a brutal Dikney's ecstasynical company in taxes that there are these tax Emil company.
48,"There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail  that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia  via his close childhood friend,  who happens to be a top cellist.","It's just traces that a trace of two billion U.S. president is running across Russia, led by a famous friend of mine and a famous cell phone."
49,And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there  and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories  and the next set of leaked documents.,"Well, there are a lot of rich people out there waiting for the next great, waiting for the next round, and they're going to kick the next document."
50,"Now, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller  or a John Grisham novel.","Now, this sounds like a agent of a Agent or a John fluke."
51,"It seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.","It seems to me by you, ordinary people."
52,Why should we care about this?,Why would that tell us what?
53,"But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals  are able to keep their money offshore  and not pay the taxes that they should,  it means that there is less money for vital public services  like healthcare, education, roads.","But the truth is, if the richness and markets are able to in charge of capital markets, no matter what it means, then that all of their tax services are in public health service, education, to bring public services like maternal."
54,And that affects all of us.,And it's true of all of us.
55,"Now, for my organization Global Witness,  this exposé has been phenomenal.","For my organization, global poverty, these Enlightenment, these phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal."
56,We have the world's media and political leaders  talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy  to hide and disguise their assets --  something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.,"Around the world, media and politicians are being used by secret hostility to graphics around them -- something that we've been discussing for, for the last 10 years, and ethnic issues."
57,"Now, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing,  and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.","I think a lot of people are very confused, and it's very difficult to understand how these tax sites work."
58,I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.,I always think of it as a Matthieflies.
59,"So you can have one company stacked inside another company,  stacked inside another company,  making it almost impossible to really understand  who is behind these structures.","So you've got a company in another company, another one, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind them."
60,"It can be very difficult for law enforcement  or tax authorities, journalists, civil society  to really understand what's going on.","It can be very difficult for fine failures and taxes, and, for journalists, or for civil society, which is really what's going on."
61,I also think it's interesting  that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.,"I think that there's also interesting, the way in the U.S. report on this story about this issue."
62,"And that's perhaps because some prominent US people  just haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.","In fact, since we haven't witnessed any prominent Americans who have gone to these Enlightenment, this sculpture that was taking place."
63,"Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans  who are stashing their assets offshore.","Now, it's not because there's no rich, the Americans pursuing their asset across taxes."
64,"It's just because of the way in which offshore works,  Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.","But the principle of working on that tax revenues, Motia clone has less American clients."
65,"I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands  or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada,  you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.","If we took a data from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming, we would see many more cases of the reshape and examples that have compounds in the U.S."
66,"In fact, in a number of US states you need less information,  you need to provide less information to get a company  than you do to get a library card.","In fact, in some places it takes less information to start a company, to set up a library so that it takes to get a library."
67,That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts  to rip off schoolchildren.,"So, these species add a transnationalation in the United States to high school district that's allowed school children to prevent school district."
68,It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.,It allows foreman to disseminate special contrence.
69,This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.,It's this sort of behavior that's all about us.
70,"Now, at Global Witness,  we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.","Here in Global Globalns, we wanted to figure out how this was in practice."
71,How does this actually work?,How does it actually work?
72,So what we did  is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.,So we sent a discovery with 13 businesses in Manhattan.
73,"Our investigator posed as an African minister  who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States  to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.","He gave an African minister who wanted to get money into the U.S. to buy a house, a tough Soviet Union."
74,"Now, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers  provided our investigator with suggestions  on how to move those suspect funds.","In fact, it occurred that all the individuals in our lawyer were making a lawyer could be paying attention."
75,"These were all preliminary meetings,  and none of the lawyers took us on as a client  and of course no money moved hands,  but it really shows the problem with the system.","These were all short-sighted people. None of those -- and of course, we were using the money to come up with the system."
76,It's also important  to not just think about this as individual cases.,It's also important that we don't consider that as individuals.
77,This is not just about an individual lawyer  who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.,This is not about an individual based upon the professional class of our hitchurn.
78,It's not just about a particular senior politician  who's been caught up in a scandal.,"It's not about a single policy maker and little, involved in an sand-population."
79,"This is about how a system works,  that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.","It's about how the system works, through the corruption, taxation, poverty and instability."
80,"And in order to tackle this,  we need to change the game.","And to cope with the rules, we have to change the game."
81,We need to change the rules of the game  to make this sort of behavior harder.,We have to change the rules in order to make these kinds of behaviors.
82,"This may seem like doom and gloom,  like there's nothing we can do about it,  like nothing has ever changed,  like there will always be rich and powerful individuals.","That very ingeniously, as if we could get nothing but as if there's nothing that ever had to change or interacted with it."
83,"But as a natural optimist,  I do see that we are starting to get some change.","But when he's born optimist, I see that some people started to change."
84,"Over the last couple of years,  we've seen a real push towards greater transparency  when it comes to company ownership.","We've seen over the last few years ago the prime ministers of transparency, and we've seen the owner of companies."
85,This issue was put on the political agenda  by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron  at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013.,The theme in Marinerlwind was found by the British David Cameron Cameron's team in the year of termic.
86,"And since then, the European Union is going to be creating  central registers at a national level  of who really owns and controls companies across Europe.","Since then, the E.U. has been slendering in the national level of who really controlled companies in Europe and who control it."
87,"One of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.",One of the things that's indeb is that it's behind the United States.
88,"There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced  in the House and the Senate,  but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.","Both parties have just put a design in both parliament in their preserving lattice, but this guy's progress that we would like to see."
89,"So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks,  this huge peek into the offshore world,  be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.","And we would really like to see a Panama chart, such as this huge expectations of the world, this huge waterfront center, being used as the tools of the United States and global transparency for much more transparency."
90,"For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.","And for us, in Global suprafaț, this is a moment for change."
91,We need ordinary people to get angry  at the way in which people can hide their identity  behind secret companies.,We need ordinary people who will see if they realize their identity as well as other people hide behind them.
92,"We need business leaders to stand up and say,  ""Secrecy like this is not good for business.""","We need leaders in business who are standing up and say, ""Inspiredo, kid to stand well."""
93,"We need political leaders to recognize the problem,  and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.",We need to have politicians who are able to recognize this problem and save laws through law.
94,"Together, we can end the secrecy  that is currently allowing tax evasion,  corruption, money laundering to flourish.","Together we can save the sensitivity, this type of taxation, corruption, including corruption and money."
95,I want to tell you the story  about the time I almost got kidnapped  in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.,This is a story -- almost like I ended up walking a suitcase in the suitcase.
96,It's the day after graduating from design school  and I'm having a yard sale.,"I finished a day after I finished design school, made a Richard Bran."
97,And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda  and he starts looking through my stuff.,A guy in the red box stayed in the red all the way and looked at my things.
98,And he buys a piece of art that I made.,He bought one of my artwork.
99,"And it turns out he's alone in town for the night,  driving cross-country on a road trip  before he goes into the Peace Corps.","He was alone in town, and he just did a road trip through the entire country, after that he'd go to peace."
100,So I invite him out for a beer  and he tells me all about his passion  for making a difference in the world.,I targeted him a beer. He told me how he wanted to change the world.
101,"Now it's starting to get late,  and I'm getting pretty tired.",It got late. I became tired.
102,"As I motion for the tab,  I make the mistake of asking him,  ""So where are you staying tonight?""","While we were paying the bills, I made the mistake, ""Where do you leave the night?"""
103,"And he makes it worse by saying,  ""Actually, I don't have a place.""","He made it worse, ""I don't know."""
104,"And I'm thinking, ""Oh, man!""","And I thought, ""Oh, man!"
105,What do you do?,"What am I doing now?"""
106,"We've all been there, right?",Who knows the situation?
107,Do I offer to host this guy?,Have some sleeping bag now?
108,"But, I just met him -- I mean,  he says he's going to the Peace Corps,  but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps  and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.","But I have only met it now, because he says he's going to go to peace, but I don't know if he really wants to go to the suitcase room. I don't want to land on a bench."
109,That's a small trunk!,This is a little cosmologist!
110,"So then I hear myself saying,  ""Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room.""","I heard a little air saying, ""I've got a air conditioner. You can sleep in my living room."""
111,"And the voice in my head goes,  ""Wait, what?""","A voice in my head said, ""Are you mind?"""
112,"That night, I'm laying in bed,  I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,  ""Oh my god, what have I done?","And I would go to bed, I'd stare at the ceiling, and I'd look at the ceiling, and I'm like, ""Oh, what's wrong with this?"
113,There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.,An poacher flies in my living room.
114,"What if he's psychotic?""","What if he's crazy?"""
115,"My anxiety grows so much,  I leap out of bed,  I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,  and I lock the bedroom door.","I was afraid that I was going to go out of bed, putting on the toes of the door, and my bedroom, and my bedroom."
116,It turns out he was not psychotic.,But he didn't even want crazy.
117,We've kept in touch ever since.,We're still in contact.
118,And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale  is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.,The piece that he had bought from me was he'd been building with his classrooms now. He's teachers.
119,"This was my first hosting experience,  and it completely changed my perspective.",That was my first experience when Gastgeber has changed my perspective.
120,Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers  were actually friends waiting to be discovered.,"Maybe the people who were being sold in the childhood when they first found friends, who were only waiting to get there?"
121,"The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me  and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.","People on my air force was replicated for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air with the air."
122,So now it's two years later.,"Let's do a point at the end of, two years later..."
123,"I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,  my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.","I'm a geekless one, almost voted out of a child, and the rent is increased."
124,"And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town,  and all the hotels are sold out.",I also learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. Everything was Retreat.
125,And I've always believed that turning fear into fun  is the gift of creativity.,I think creativity can transform fear.
126,"So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky:  ""Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks --  turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,'  offering young designers who come to town a place to crash,  complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space,  sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.","I wrote my best friend and new boyfriend in Briansky, and I said, ""Bsky, I suppose we could make a difference to how we might earn a designer: our housing and a car-sharing company, including 9-11, and a morning, including breakfast."
127,"Ha!""","Ha!"""
128,We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.,"We built a website, and we formed a website called breakfast, which is a Ottawa passage for Allendemicry Institute."
129,Three lucky guests got to stay  on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.,Three happyÜbrigen had been given to us for 20 dollars on the air conditioner in wooden floor.
130,"But they loved it, and so did we.","They found it hard, and we also."
131,"I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made  tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.",I'm sure our cheese sandwich set aside very different because it makes us different.
132,"We took them on adventures around the city,  and when we said goodbye to the last guest,  the door latch clicked,  Brian and I just stared at each other.","We were around with them all the city. When we passed our final towed, we passed the door to Brian and I was staring at us."
133,Did we just discover it was possible to make friends  while also making rent?,Did we find our friends the same thing at the same time that we knew what our rent was paying lately?
134,The wheels had started to turn.,The things came in.
135,"My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,  joined as engineering co-founder.","My former lunch front, Natasha rows, decided to give us a resat."
136,And we buckled down to see  if we could turn this into a business.,We wanted to see if we could make a business idea.
137,"Here's what we pitched investors:  ""We want to build a website  where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces,  their bedrooms, the bathrooms --  the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.","So we came up with a investors: ""We want a website, in fact, post-conflict people's public spaces, your bedroom ofsprech, your room -- the kind of things you let them go by, when you let them in."
138,"And then, over the Internet,  they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.",The Internet then can invite them to overestimate with human beings.
139,"It's going to be huge!""","This will be the next big thing."""
140,"We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.",We were waiting for rocket science.
141,It did not.,They're not.
142,No one in their right minds would invest in a service  that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.,"Nobody who has hardly invested at all of this, would invest in a business that allows people to sleep at night."
143,Why?,Why?
144,"Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.",Because we've all learned that strangers are dangerous.
145,"Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know,  and all we really knew was design.","If you've got a problem, well, what we're able to do is we could design things."
146,"In art school, you learn that design is much more  than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.",The school of art in the Academy is that we had learned a lot more than just design and Haptical -- it's the overall kind of thing.
147,"We learned to do that for objects,  but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust  between people who had never met.","We'd learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create huge trust between people that had never met before."
148,Could design make that happen?,Can design do that?
149,Is it possible to design for trust?,Is it possible to create trust and design?
150,I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust  that we were aiming to achieve.,"I want to give you a coconutzeigte, which is what we used to take."
151,I've got a 30-second experiment  that will push you past your comfort zone.,"It's a 30-second experiment, it will force you to get out of your comfort zone."
152,"If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.",There are ready when you go.
153,"OK, I need you to take out your phones.",Take your phone in your hand.
154,"Now that you have your phone out,  I'd like you to unlock your phone.",So here's what I'd like you to do. You'd be painting your cell phone.
155,Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.,Give your posh your cell phone next to you.
156,That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now --    is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.,"This one's empty flight, which you have right now -- -- is exactly what the hostility you open the door open, when they open the door."
157,Because the only thing more personal than your phone  is your home.,"Because that's the only personal thing your cell phone, your home is your home."
158,"People don't just see your messages,  they see your bedroom,  your kitchen, your toilet.","éps can't just read your text, you can see your bedroom, your toilet."
159,"Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?",How does it feel to keep a mobile phone in your hands?
160,Most of us feel really responsible.,Most people feel the responsibility.
161,That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.,"That's how most guests feel about each other, when they're different about anything."

170,Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?,How would you feel if you had to give your cell phone?
171,a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.,Because it was a feedback system that trusts the trust system.
172,And we didn't actually get it right the first time.,At first we've done a couple of things wrong.
173,It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.,It was hard for people to give negative judgments.
174,"Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts  left the review before we reveal them.","We ended up waiting for the very thing, and with their Gastgebers and their judgments before we reached them online."
175,"Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.",We've discovered something new last week.
176,"We did a joint study with Stanford,  where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone  based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.","We did a study of Stanford. We were looking at how likely it is to trust each other, depending on how people are similar to age-related, and housing."

180,"But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix,  in this case, with reviews.","You have a race that's being addd by the person -- when you add a person's notice, in our case."

184,The right design can actually help us overcome  one of our most deeply rooted biases.,So the right design can help us figure out a few of our deep ancestors.
185,Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust  takes the right amount of disclosure.,And we also learned that trust is depending on how much you focus.
186,This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.,And here you see the reaction to the first news.
187,"If you share too little, like, ""Yo,""  acceptance rates go down.","If you tell it to a little bit, like, ""Here's kind of the answer!"""
188,"And if you share too much, like,  ""I'm having issues with my mother,""    acceptance rates also go down.","Narrator: For example, how much you have in trouble, I'm dealing with my mother's problems -- rather than also not taken?"
189,"But there's a zone that's just right,  like, ""Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family.""","So there's the optimal feeling of openness, it's like, ""Great. Bless art"" I'm doing on my home."
190,So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?,"How can you create this kind of design, to petrochemicalness?"

425,One of the limitations with tail-sitters  is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.,A limitation from zeera is that they respond to Turing wind like wind.
426,We're developing new control architectures and algorithms  that address this limitation.,We're developing new taxes and algorithms to improve this.
427,"The idea is for the aircraft to recover  no matter what state it finds itself in,  and through practice, improve its performance over time.",The idea behind this is that the device does matter which amount of money gets regulated and recover the power from it.
428,OK.,Okay.
429,"When doing research,  we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions  that try to get at the heart of a matter.","So, as we imagine we're often extending the abstract questions, which actually brings us to the core issue."
430,"For example, one such question would be,  what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?","So, for example, a question would be: what's the smallest number of siractive in control?"
431,"Now, there are practical reasons  why you may want to know the answer to such a question.",There are practically reasons to be able to know the answer to this question.
432,"Helicopters, for example,  are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts  all conspiring to do you bodily harm.",Hubble are about a thousand machines that go together make them happens to hurt.
433,"It turns out that decades ago,  skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft  that had only two moving parts:  a propeller and a tail rudder.","A decades ago, piloted pilots could fly away, two-by-side bombs that had only been a flier and a monetary device."
434,We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.,We've discovered that flying flies are working with only one.
435,"This is the monospinner,  the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine,  invented just a few months ago.",This is the monopolypin that mechanistical flight vehicle was invented just before short. It was invented.
436,"It has only one moving part, a propeller.",It just has a swacky part of a prop.
437,"It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,  no other actuators, no other control surfaces,  just a simple propeller.","There's no shortcuts, no forceing, no other sporadic, no control, just a props."
438,"Even though it's mechanically simple,  there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain  to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.","Although it's really crude, in the interior, there's a lot of stuff that's going on, so it can fly around and start to move."
439,"Even so, it doesn't yet have  the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter,  which means that in order to get it to fly,  I have to throw it just right.","However, what this does not do about the elegant algorithm of the game, and to make it fly. To make it really, I must throw it right."
440,"And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low,  given everybody watching me,  what we're going to do instead  is show you a video that we shot last night.","I think the chance that they get to see is to me if I'm entirely a video that's gotten you last night, that's why I got filmed."

460,"Because each unit knows where it is in space  and is self-controlled,  there is really no limit to their number.","Each unit knows where it is in the room, and that's why there's no topography."
461,"Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up  new revolutionary roles for flying machines.",Hopefully you're trying to get these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.
462,That ultrasafe one over there for example  has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.,And the particular machine's especially like these to be able to fly over there.
463,The reality is that it is difficult to predict  the impact of nascent technology.,"Of course, it's hard to predict the impact of these technologies."
464,"And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.","As it happens to us, the lung is in the development and the sound."
465,"It's a continual reminder  of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is,  that it allows creative, clever creatures  to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.","It's in memory as a memories, and our universe is constructed, and it allows us to shape creative minds in such a way that they so spectacular."

476,"Since then, Earth has made and evolved  corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet.","And since, the Earth has been restoring some corals: fish, plants, plant, people, and even the Internet -- even the Internet."
477,"And about 25 years ago,  a particularly audacious set of people --  Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech --  to build a giant laser detector  with which to search for the gravitational waves  from things like colliding black holes.","About 25 years ago, a group of courage -- a particularly mutations from MIT, Dr. invited by Caltech and Ronald Reagan, looking for a giant laser, to look for gravity, the black holes that creates a squatter black holes."
478,"Now, most people thought they were nuts.",Most people thought they were mad.
479,But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts  that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.,"But enough people, when they realized crazy gene so that the U.S. National Science Foundation was funded by their idea."
480,"So after decades of development,  construction and imagination  and a breathtaking amount of hard work,  they built their detector, called LIGO:  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.","After ten years of developing construction, construction, concepts, concepts and extremely hard work, they built the laser detectors: laser carries laser machines."
481,"For the last several years,  LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy,  a tremendous improvement in its detection ability.","And by a consequence of the representation, prevention elements of Impossibility could be hugely improved."
482,It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.,"So, you know, let's call this Advancedziel."
483,"In early September of 2015,  LIGO turned on for a final test run  while they sorted out a few lingering details.","In September 2015, Central Valley was launched for a whole test cycle for some small, hard problems to address."
484,"And on September 14 of 2015,  just days after the detector had gone live,  the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes  passed through the Earth.","And on 14th, just a few days after the 2015, the gravitational waves of these two black holes wiped out through the ground."

487,Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life  more emotionally intense than that.,Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life were more emotional than this.
488,One is the birth of my daughter.,The daughter of my daughter.
489,The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.,And from my father decided.
490,"You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.","Basically, these were the fruits of my life."
491,"Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction!   Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes,  a theoretical physicist at MIT,  who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes  and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO,  So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.","All the things I've been working on, which is not my science fiction. AA: [Arecoma] [little a great friend Scott and the physicists work, on MIT, he's been looking for 23 years of black holes and dreaming through, what are the more friendly societies like he? What are?"
492,A gravitational wave is a ripple  in the shape of space and time.,"It's a gravitational wave, a sound in space and time."
493,"As the wave passes by,  it stretches space and everything in it  in one direction,  and compresses it in the other.","In front of the waves will be leaning, and the whole content will be facing in one direction and matched in another."
494,This has led to countless instructors of general relativity  doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.,"There is a lot of dopamine in the course of relativity, quite often, right?"
495,"""It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands.""","""Deah, stand and relax."""
496,So the trouble with gravitational waves  is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.,"The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."
497,"For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 --  and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed  under the action of that wave --  when the waves hit, they stretched the average person  by one part in 10 to the 21.","On 14th, for instance, everyone was touched by us, and the waves had jumped into a wave of average people."
498,"That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,  That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.","That is, 20 zero tolerance, followed by the following of a 1,500-fistance laborer commitment to crazy."
499,Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy --  they would have to measure the length of those detectors  to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus  of an atom.,"With five kilometers, and then this is absurd, and already there would be a thousand-fets on your a less than a thousand pounds of a radius of a nuclear attack. That's larger than that."
500,And that's preposterous.,"At the end of his classic text, it spreads over gravity."
501,"So towards the end of his classic text on gravity,  described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows:  He said, ""The technical difficulties to be surmounted  in constructing such detectors are enormous.","Thor Thorians wrote a puddle, in the process of setting up the waves -- the thing that said is, ""This is how a technical detector if you want to build such thing."
502,"But physicists are ingenious,  and with the support of a broad lay public,  all obstacles will surely be overcome.""","But physicists are inventors, and with the support of the public they are all destined to cross-cultural obstacles."""
503,"Thorne published that in 1973,  42 years before he succeeded.","Thorms published this one, 42 years ago, in 1973."
504,"Now, coming back to LIGO,  Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye.","Well, back to MatheGO, Scott I liked to claim that doing more than one eye is a eye."
505,I want to explain what that means.,I want to explain what this means.
506,"Visible light has a wavelength, a size,  that's much smaller than the things around you,  the features on people's faces,  the size of your cell phone.","To the invisible light has a wave that's much smaller than the things around us: faces, the size of your cell phone."
507,"And that's really useful,  because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you,  by looking at the light coming from different spots  in the scene about you.","And it's fairly practical, because you can actually get a picture of things, or is by taking a look at multiple points of light around you, right?"
508,Sound is different.,It's the same in the sound.
509,Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.,"Listens, sound's a wavelength of up to 15 meters."
510,"And that makes it really difficult --  in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image  of something you really care about.","That's basically a very hard way to make things a picture of you, which means one of you."
511,Your child's face.,Her face's face about a child.
512,"Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch  and tone and rhythm and volume  to infer a story behind the sounds.","Instead, what we're learning is that we're reading about all the traits and the rhythms and sounds and the loud, to close the story down."
513,That's Alice talking.,"""The where Alice is talking now."""
514,That's Bob interrupting.,"""And Bob will live."""
515,Silly Bob.,"""Dummerry Bob."""
516,"So, the same is true of gravitational waves.",The same thing applies to gravitational waves.
517,We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.,We can't take pictures of them with simple pictures of objects.
518,"But by listening to changes  in the amplitude and frequency of those waves,  we can hear the story that those waves are telling.","But by changing changes in the ambiguity and frequency and frequency on waves, we can listen to their stories."
519,"And at least for LIGO,  the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.","At least for the healthiest sound there, that's the equalityal line."
520,"So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound,  we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.","So if we can convert waves into sound, we can literally hear those things."
521,"For example, listening to gravity, just in this way,  can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes,  something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.","The gravitational pull of gravity, it can tell us about two black holes more, with a lot of black holes already, where my colleague has been."
522,"SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop!","SH: Two black holes, not just flipping, just woop!"
523,"If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp,  but with a modulation on top of it,  so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!","So the two very quickly you hear the same body with a little goat, and those sound starts to change -- ya! You know."
524,It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.,"It's a kind of moving body, spreads in the waves of a wave."
525,"AA: So on September 14, 2015,  a date that's definitely going to live in my memory,  LIGO heard this:  [Whirring sound]  So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --   SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses,  that were whirling around at a rate  comparable to what goes on in your blender.","AA: On the one hand, John Mae, I never heard that, I'll ever hear, behold, the sound of which the sound is -- somebody who's had to hear, can see as a black holes, maybe the 30-day sun moves from the 30-second street corners, the way two black holes are spinning so fast as the shape is bounds."
526,AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.,"AA: Let's think for a moment, which means something."
527,"Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe,  one with a mass of 29 Suns  and one with a mass of 36 Suns,  whirling around each other 100 times per second  before they collide.","Two black holes, the body in space, one with a mass of 29 minutes before they even start, with a mass of 36 times a second, before they collide."
528,Just imagine the power of that.,Imagine this forces.
529,It's fantastic.,Great.
530,And we know it because we heard it.,And we know that because we've heard about it.
531,That's the lasting importance of LIGO.,It really matters what the next from LIGO.
532,It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe  that we've never had before.,"In LI, under a completely new way to explore the risks of space, they never had before."
533,It's a way that lets us hear the Universe  and hear the invisible.,"That's how we can listen to the space, and I can hear the invisible."
534,And there's a lot out there that we can't see --  in practice or even in principle.,"So a lot of this can basically be done, basically -- we can't see it a lot about it."
535,"So supernova, for example:  I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.","A supernova explosion, for example. I would like to know why massive stars explode into supernovaes."
536,They're very useful;  we've learned a lot about the Universe from them.,They're very useful. We've learned a lot from them about the whole thing.
537,"The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core,  and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers  of iron and carbon and silicon.","You know, the interesting physical chemistry happen in the back of thousands, 40,000 miles away from iron, and carbon is hidden in this."
538,"We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.",We never get to see because those compact are like that.
539,"Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass --  The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore  the first few moments of the Universe,  but we'll never see them,  because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.","Gravity pervasive of ironies -- it's transparent. And the Big Bang I would love to explore the first few minutes of space: we'll never see it, but we will see it because the Big Bang will be stacked off the Big Bang."
540,"With gravitational waves,  we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.","With gravity, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."
541,"Perhaps most importantly,  I'm positive that there are things out there  that we've never seen  that we may never be able to see  and that we haven't even imagined --  things that we'll only discover by listening.","And I think the most important thing is that, if we exist in space, we'll never see any of the things we've ever seen, and we haven't even seen."
542,"And in fact, even in that very first event,  LIGO found things that we didn't expect.","In fact, in effect, LIGO was the first things we didn't expect."
543,"Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration,  Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:   Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes  that we observed here  are the dinosaurs of the Universe.","My colleague at MIT, Matt Fuller, who's a great member of the salesman at MIT -- says, look at this subject matter: The kind of black holes like LI Mathe, they're the dinosaurs."
544,"They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times,  and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones  with which we do this archeology.",They're tremendously eeries. They're black holes made out of time to get these black holes in our geological time.
545,"So it lets us really get a whole nother angle  on what's out there in the Universe  and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course,  how we came to be out of this whole mess.",LIGO gives us a completely different view of the understatement of stars and ultimately the result of how we looked at how we made these chaos.
546,AA: Our challenge now  is to be as audacious as possible.,AA: The challenge now is to just be as bold as possible.
547,"Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors  that can listen to the Universe,  to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.","You know, thanks to Ungariaes, and we built great detectors and cosmopolitan."
548,"Our job is to dream up and build new observatories --  a whole new generation of observatories --  on the ground, in space.",We need ideas for new approaches -- a whole new generation of infrastructure and Earth.
549,"I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?",Because what could possibly be more beautiful than the Big Bang?

795,So I'm a neurosurgeon.,I'm a neurosurgeon.
796,"And like most of my colleagues,  I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.","Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedy."
797,I realize how your life can change from one second to the other  after a major stroke or after a car accident.,"I know how your life can change for another second or a stroke, after a car crash."
798,"And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons  is to realize that unlike other organs of the body,  the brain has very little ability for self-repair.","For us neuroscientists, it's very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to heal itself."
799,"And after a major injury of your central nervous system,  the patients often remain with a severe handicap.","After a heavy injury, the central nervous system often have patients who remain a lot, actually a very difficult disability."
800,And that's probably the reason why I've chosen  to be a functional neurosurgeon.,I guess that's the reason I got functional neurobiology.
801,What is a functional neurosurgeon?,What is a functional neuroscientific neurology?
802,It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function  through different surgical strategies.,A doctor who tried to improve the nerves in various cases.
803,"You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones  called deep brain stimulation,  where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain  in order to modulate a circuit of neurons  to improve a neurological function.","Certainly they've heard of some of the most famous brain called the ""Thirsenses"" that allows you to have an electrode in the brain to actually change the circuitry of the neurons."
804,"It's really an amazing technology  in that it has improved the destiny of patients  with Parkinson's disease,  with severe tremor, with severe pain.","It's really an amazing technology. It has the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which is disseminate pain and severe pains."
805,"However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.",But neurobiology doesn't mean neurologic diseases.
806,And the dream of functional neurosurgeons  is to repair the brain.,The dream of functional neuroscientist is the Again of the brain.
807,I think  that we are approaching this dream.,I think that we are closer to this dream.
808,And I would like to show you  that we are very close to this.,I want to show you that we're very close to.
809,"And that with a little bit of help,  the brain is able to help itself.",With something able to help itself.
810,So the story started 15 years ago.,The story began 15 years ago.
811,"At that time, I was a chief resident  working days and nights in the emergency room.","At the time I was a kid, I was working night and day, and night were working in the emergency room."
812,I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.,I often have a patient with skull-tail-paying space.
813,"You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma,  his brain is swelling  and he's increasing his intracranial pressure.","Now you've got to imagine that with skull, the brain tumor goes up and down the skull."
814,"And in order to save his life,  you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.","To save the life, you have to limit the damage."
815,you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.,And what you have to do sometimes is remove you a part of the brain.
816,"So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain,  we decided with Jean-François Brunet,  who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,  to study them.","Instead of studying the brain is a swollen with Jean-volume, we decided to trawler, to analyze a biologist's brain."
817,What do I mean by that?,What do I mean by that?
818,We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.,We wanted to grow cells from that tissue.
819,It's not an easy task.,There is no easy task.
820,Growing cells from a piece of tissue  is a bit the same as growing very small children  out from their family.,"If you grow out of a tissue to grow up, it's comparable to kids that are actually taken out of your families."
821,"So you need to find the right nutrients,  the warmth, the humidity  and all the nice environments to make them thrive.","You have to figure out the right diet, humidity and environment to let them go to ad."
822,So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.,And we had to do that in these cells.
823,"And after many attempts,  Jean-François did it.","After many experiments, it created Jean-section."
824,And that's what he saw under his microscope.,That's what he saw underneath his microscope.
825,"And that was, for us, a major surprise.",That was a big surprise for us.
826,Why?,Why?
827,"Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture,  with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.","It looked exactly like a stem cell culture, and with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, inadequate cells."
828,"And you may remember from biology class  that stem cells are immature cells,  able to turn into any type of cell of the body.","And you might know, you still know, if you have a few cells in biology, stem cells are forming every cell type in the organism."
829,"The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare  and they're located in deep and small niches  in the depths of the brain.","The adult brain cells have, but very few, in deep, are hidden in the low brain."
830,So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture  from the superficial part of swollen brain we had  in the operating theater.,It's surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface of the brain tissue to keep in the psychedel.
831,"And there was another intriguing observation:  Regular stem cells are very active cells --  cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.","We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells, they're very active -- they share very fast."
832,"And they never die, they're immortal cells.","They're dying, they're not dying."
833,But these cells behave differently.,But these cells relowed.
834,"They divide slowly,  and after a few weeks of culture,  they even died.","They were starting to come back up a few weeks, and they died even."
835,So we were in front of a strange new cell population  that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.,"So we saw a new cell population in which it looked like stem cells, but they got different."
836,And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.,It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
837,They come from these cells.,It's just coming from these cells.
838,These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.,"These blue cells are called red, and red- incumbent cells."
839,All of you have them in your brain.,We all have it in our brains.
840,They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.,They're doing four percent of our big brain cells.
841,They have a very important role during the development stage.,They are playing a very important role in our development.
842,"When you were fetuses,  they helped your brain to fold itself.","Now, at the stage of the flutes, they are putting the fals into the falsal brain."
843,But why do they stay in your head?,But why are they willing to get us?
844,"This, we don't know.",We don't know.
845,We think that they may participate in brain repair  because we find them in higher concentration  close to brain lesions.,"We believe they're part of the brain because we're involved in in more concentrations, we're finding out of brain disorders."
846,But it's not so sure.,This is not sure.
847,"But there is one clear thing --  that from these cells,  we got our stem cell culture.",But one of the things about these cells is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.
848,And we were in front of a potential new source of cells  to repair the brain.,We're destined from a potential cell to fix the brain.
849,And we had to prove this.,So we had to prove it.
850,we decided to design an experimental paradigm.,So we decided to come in.
851,"The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain  in a non-eloquent area of the brain,  and then to culture the cells  exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.","We didn't want to take a piece of brain out of the water and then place it like the cells, as it did, and the action is."
852,"And then label them, to put color in them  in order to be able to track them in the brain.",And then they're able to track it in the brain so that they can follow.
853,And the last step was to re-implant them  in the same individual.,We're actually last step back to the discovery of the same individual.
854,We call these  autologous grafts -- autografts.,We call that the autobiology -- the auto transplant.
855,"So the first question we had,  ""What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain,  and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells  in a lesioned brain?""","One of the first questions we had is: What if we combine those cells in normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we do the same cells in the same brain tissue?"
856,"Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller,  we worked with monkeys.","Thanks to the help of the playwright, Eric routine could we work with monkeys."
857,"So in the first-case scenario,  we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain  and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks,  as if they were taken from the brain,  they go back home,  the space is already busy,  they are not needed there, so they disappear.","The first scenario, we re-growing the cells into a healthy brain, and we noticed that they were completely gone as if they were completely gone back to home. So the space has not taken place, they're not needed to go there."
858,"In the second-case scenario,  we performed the lesion,  we re-implanted exactly the same cells,  and in this case, the cells remained --  and they became mature neurons.","The second scenario, we added an injury and correlated them just the same cells, and now the cells growing -- they grew to retain that cells."
859,And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.,And that's what we see underneath the microscope.
860,Those are the cells that were re-implanted.,These are the cells that were being run on this.
861,"And the proof they carry,  these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled  in vitro, when they were in culture.",The evidence that they show are these little dots. These are the cells that we said in vitros.
862,"But we could not stop here, of course.",We couldn't stop there.
863,Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?,"Do these cells also have the same cell, to catch on a brain tumor?"
864,"So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.",So we trained monkeys with a manual deeflake.
865,They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.,And they had to use the food stacks up from a tray.
866,They were very good at it.,They were doing great.
867,"And when they had reached a plateau of performance,  we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.","When they reached stable, we had injured health care, we had a decrease in the motor skills of the African."
868,"So the monkeys were plegic,  they could not move their hand anymore.","And on this monkeys, they couldn't move the hand anymore."
869,"And exactly the same as humans would do,  they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent,  exactly the same as after a stroke.","In the same way that it would happen, at people who would hunt like you to some degree, just like a stroke."
870,"Patients are completely plegic,  and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism,  they recover to a certain extent,  exactly the same for the monkey.","The patients are paralyzed, and then they try to bring in a plastic-based, sort of, employ them as they do."
871,"So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau  of spontaneous recovery,  we implanted his own cells.","When we were certain that the monkey had gotten his own cells, we pop its own cells."
872,"So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.",On the left you see the monkeys flowing.
873,He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance  before the lesion.,"He can bring about 40 to 50 percent of his original performance, he can bring injury to injury."
874,"He's not so accurate, not so quick.",It's not that precise and not that fast.
875,"And look now, when we re-impant the cells:  Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.","Now, take a look at the cells as we passed the same A, two months after the oppressor."
876,"It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.","I can tell you, that was also very exciting for us."
877,"Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.","Since that time, we've been able to find out a lot more about these cells."
878,"We know that we can cryopreserve them,  we can use them later on.",We can try them and later.
879,"We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models,  like Parkinson's disease, for example.","We can use them for example, in other neurologic models, for example."
880,But our dream is still to implant them in humans.,"But our dream is still, it's supporting them to implant."
881,And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon  that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.,"I really hope that I can show you a human brain, which is that there is a means to heal itself."
882,Thank you.,Thank you very much.
883,"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,  and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience,  possibly even a majority,  who are thinking, ""I know somebody who can use this.""","Bruno Giussani: Jovtal, which is wonderful, I'm sure, just now several people in the audience think, ""I know somebody who need the most."""
884,"I do, in any case.",I certainly agree.
885,"And of course the question is,  what are the biggest obstacles  before you can go into human clinical trials?","Of course, the question is: Of course, what are the biggest obstacles before you start to clinical trials on people."
886,"Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations.   So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out  about two kilograms of papers and forms  to be able to go through these kind of trials.",Joce sheall these largest obstacles are the authorities. And the authorities in order to fill these two kilograms of paper and form it through studies to run from studies.
887,"BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.","BG: That's understand, the brain is very depressed and so forth."
888,"JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time  and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?","JB: Yes, but it takes a long time to get a lot of patience and a professional team."
889,"BG: If you project yourself --  having done the research  and having tried to get permission to start the trials,  if you project yourself out in time,  how many years before somebody gets into a hospital  and this therapy is available?","BG: Look here in the future -- you have the research and you're trying to get the clinical trials for the sake of the clinical trials. If you look forward in the future, it can take many years to get somebody to come to the hospital and do that therapy will be available."
890,"JB: So, it's very difficult to say.",JB: That's hard to tell.
891,"It depends, first, on the approval of the trial.","First of all, it's a clinical trial."
892,Will the regulation allow us to do it soon?,Will we allow the audience to start it soon?
893,"And then, you have to perform this kind of study  in a small group of patients.",And then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.
894,"So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients,  do the treatment  and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.",And it takes a long time to pick patients who need to actually construct treatment and to see if it's useful to make this kind of treatment.
895,And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.,And then you have to apply that to a multi-touch study.
896,You have to really prove first that it's useful  before offering this treatment up for everybody.,You really have to prove to first that it's useful before you can offer that treatment.
897,"BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.","BG: And it's sure, of course, JB."
898,"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.","BG: Thank you, Jovunne and for coming to TED, and tell us you about it."
899,BG: Thank you.,BG: Thank you very much.
900,Democracy.,Democracy.
901,"In the West,  we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.",We make a big mistake in the West; we take it for granted.
902,"We see democracy  not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is,  but we see it as part of our society's furniture.",We see that democracy is not as the fragile plant; it's actually as aInvent to our society.
903,We tend to think of it as an intransigent given.,We tend to view them as inevitable.
904,We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.,We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.
905,It doesn't.,It's not true.
906,"Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing  that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism,  spectacular growth,  while politics remains democracy-free.","Lee Kuan Yee from Singapore and his great descendants have proven that it's possible that by a blackboard is possibly driven by a black capitalism, and amazing growth while the politics are completely democratized."
907,"Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods,  here in Europe.",It is indeed exhilarating in Europe.
908,"Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece --  the newly elected Greek government --  in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,  I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process --  our elections --  could not be allowed to interfere  with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.","By the beginning of the year when I was shut out of Greek government -- the financial government, I realized that the finance industry -- our country -- were not democratized, was called the elections."
909,"At that moment,  I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,  or the Chinese Communist Party,  indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me  that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.","And in that moment, I was thinking that there would be no better right or for Lee Yew, or the communist parties, or the communist party of my friends who said to me that if democracy drew me, it would change anything."
910,"Tonight, here, I want to present to you  an economic case for an authentic democracy.","So, at this point I'm going to give you an economic model for a real democracy."
911,"I want to ask you to join me in believing again  that Lee Kuan Yew,  the Chinese Communist Party  and indeed the Eurogroup  are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy --  that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.","I'm asking you, with me, to believe that  Lee Kuanor, the communists and even the Euros and China could save us a democracy, but we truly need a great democracy."
912,"And without democracy,  our societies will be nastier,  our future bleak  and our great, new technologies wasted.","Because without democracy, our society will really apply to our great futures and our new technology."
913,"Speaking of waste,  allow me to point out an interesting paradox  that is threatening our economies as we speak.","Now, I want to point out the topic that I'd like to point out to you is what's happening on the basis of our economy."
914,I call it the twin peaks paradox.,"I call it the ""TV-to- scrapation."""
915,"One peak you understand --  you know it, you recognize it --  is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow  over the United States, Europe, the whole world.","A top apple is known as the school limb. You know him as the shoulders of the United States, the shadow of its long shadow, Europe, and we're all over the world."
916,We all recognize the mountain of debts.,We all recognize the shoulders of schoolenberg.
917,But few people discern its twin.,Not only a few people recognize their twins.
918,"A mountain of idle cash  belonging to rich savers and to corporations,  too terrified to invest it  into the productive activities that can generate the incomes  from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts  and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs,  like green energy.","A mine that belongs to a hole that involves both the speedsworkers and the hearing that it is -- though it has to invest in, as a ""ly Idune"" for the school board, it would be able to create the revenue that could provide humanity's ""othermal energy."""
919,Now let me give you two numbers.,I'll give you two numbers.
920,"Over the last three months,  in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone,  we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars  on all the wealth-producing goods --  things like industrial plants, machinery,  office blocks, schools,  roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.","In the past three months, in the U.S. and the U.K., England have been invested in Britain on a trillions, hospitals where all the wealth, industry-speaking, roads, road systems, schools, roads, etc."
921,"$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money  until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion  that has been slushing around in the same countries,  in our financial institutions,  doing absolutely nothing during the same period  except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.","Basically, a trillion-dollar U.S.-American dollars is equal a lot of money to the clients who people are dying in the same countries, in the same area, in which our financial services and our financial services, except the real estate made absolutely nothing but the real price tag."
922,"So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash  form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets.","And in a way, school and ina general, the kind of productive Over-minded, rather than the market-based businesses."
923,"The result is stagnant wages,  more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe  And consequently, low aggregate demand,  which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors,  who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing --  exactly like Oedipus' father,  who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle  that his son would grow up to kill him,","As a result, there are more element of the wages -- more than a quarter of the United States, and Europe, in the USA, and the president -- following the economy of a low-income demand for a low-income economic demand era, one that is becoming lower, that, even if the propensity of the neighbors themselves don't invest in the plane, in fact that they could be recognized as a doctor, that the cliffs will grow."
924,"unwittingly engineered the conditions  that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.","Except, according to the circumstances, which leads the ecstaticly."
925,This is my quarrel with capitalism.,That's my in-law.
926,"Its gross wastefulness,  all this idle cash,  should be energized to improve lives,  to develop human talents,  and indeed to finance all these technologies,  green technologies,  which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.","It enables him to move away with the technology-intentioned way to create our lives, in particular, of human talent and particularly the technology that these are critical for the Earth."
927,Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?,"So, is democracy accelerating?"
928,"I believe so,  but before we move on,  what do we mean by democracy?",I think we continue. But before we understand democracy?
929,"Aristotle defined democracy  as the constitution in which the free and the poor,  being in the majority, control government.","Aristotle defined as a society, in the charter and the poor, are ignoring the government as a majority."
930,"Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.","Gever democracy decided, of course, too many."
931,"Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves.","Women, foreign, and, of course, slave."
932,But it would be a mistake  to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy  on the basis of whom it excluded.,But it would be a mistake that matched the curb of democracy because of that exhilaration.
933,"What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy,  was the inclusion of the working poor,  who not only acquired the right to free speech,  but more importantly, crucially,  they acquired the rights to political judgments  that were afforded equal weight  in the decision-making concerning matters of state.","The key thing in democracy was that they were working on democracy and they were not only working on free political justice, but more important, they asked them the rights of political policies on issues and the culture of governance."
934,"Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.","That is, a democracy has not stopped very long."
935,"Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.","Or as a candle -- very bright, it's also blown up fast."
936,"And indeed,  our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.",But our liberals today have not delivered their roots in anti-particles.
937,"They have their roots in the Magna Carta,  in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,  indeed in the American constitution.","It's in magnesium, in the middle of 1688, even in the American Revolution."
938,"Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen  and empowering the working poor,  our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition,  which was, after all, a charter for masters.","As democracy adapted to the free citizens and the poor, our liberal democracy based on the values of democracy, who was a set of options for Mr."
939,"And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible  to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere,  so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere,  leaving the economic sphere --  the corporate world, if you want --  as a democracy-free zone.","Because the liberal democracy came along, as a complete representation of politics and economic process, which became much more democratic in the economy -- as the world was shut down."
940,"Now, in our democracies today,  this separation of the economic from the political sphere,  it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two,  with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power.","In our '96, since the present time period, that discovery started by politics and economy, a rather unfinished battle between the two that the economy was hummingbirdous and them."
941,Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?,So why don't politicians get more than they used to?
942,It's not because their DNA has degenerated.,It's not one of their DNA.
943,"It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power,  because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere,  which is separate.","It's because you can't be in government today, and yet, in power, the power of politics is largely separate from the economies and the areas."
944,I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.,I mentioned my Hads in capitalism.
945,"If you think about it,  it is a little bit like a population of predators,  that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on,  that in the end they starve.","Now, if you think about it, it's kind of like a predatory trawling that's separating animals, so depleted, they end up in the end."
946,"Similarly,  the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere  to such an extent that it is undermining itself,  Corporate power is increasing,  political goods are devaluing,  inequality is rising,  aggregate demand is falling  and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.","Similar, with economic policy, the politics, has so far influenced that it's growing through the power of economic policy. The force itself is growing, the assets that are driven by political goods, the demand for business that is centralized, and the driver of the business that is governed by economic policy."
947,"So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy,  the taller the twin peaks  and the greater the waste of human resources  and humanity's wealth.","The successful capitalism of capitalism have been driving in the pervasive people, the higher twins, and the greater good, of mankind, of the human spirit."
948,"Clearly, if this is right,  we must reunite the political and economic spheres  and better do it with a demos being in control,  like in ancient Athens except without the slaves  or the exclusion of women and migrants.","If it is true, we have to bring politics and the economy to bring together, and it would be better off the cosmos, in which the ancient Atmos were."
949,"Now, this is not an original idea.","This is not new idea, by the way."
950,"The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago  and it didn't go very well, did it?","The toxic link for this idea had already made of 100 years ago, and it didn't look a little good."
951,"The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle  is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered,  as they were in ancient Athens,  without creating new forms of brutality and waste.",The lesson from the Soviet Union should be that the Soviet Union should be just working in an anti-preted way through a miracle that made that new species without a new way of stairstair.
952,But there is a solution:  eliminate the working poor.,But there's a solution: the poor are making arm.
953,"Capitalism's doing it  by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.","capitalism is doing it by controlling the reward, by plethoralization and replaced by robots."
954,"The problem is  that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate,  automation makes the twin peaks taller,  the waste loftier  and the social conflicts deeper,  including -- soon, I believe --  in places like China.","The problem is that the economics and political will sustain a long way to get the trade-offs of the topography that are higher, and the social conflict, as it's coming in a very deep -- as I think in countries."
955,"So we need to reconfigure,  we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres,  but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere,  lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy  that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.","So we have to rebuild the economies and the policies and politics and political communication, and we re-imagining that if we reframe the impacts of democratic democracy, otherwise we get back into the movies of another kind of ""x a take action."""
956,So the question is not whether capitalism will survive  the technological innovations it is spawning.,"So, the question is not whether capitalism has brought about the engineering that he's chosen."
957,"The more interesting question  is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia  or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society,  where machines serve the humans  and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe  and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life  in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.","The interesting question is whether capitalism is caused by a crammed into ""The Iliatri,"" or ""Star Trek,"" or ""Star Trek,"" is something that happens in society, in which people serve to their energy and take on, or in the study of the universe, or in which a high-tech element of anti-American life, the ancient Greek conversation."
958,I think we can afford to be optimistic.,I think we can be optimistic.
959,"But what would it take, what would it look like  to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?","So what would it take to look like ""Star Trek,"" where it could have ""Star Trek"" instead of ""Waring Dyie?"""
960,"In practical terms,  allow me to share just briefly,  a couple of examples.","And in the virtually, I would like to give you some examples of this, some examples."
961,"At the level of the enterprise,  imagine a capital market,  where you earn capital as you work,  and where your capital follows you from one job to another,  from one company to another,  and the company --  whichever one you happen to work at at that time --  is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.","In the midst of the businesses, please ask you, while you're working in your market, you're working with money, and the next company, you follow a company, and the company you're working -- whatever they're working -- is property in the company."
962,"Then all income stems from capital, from profits,  and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.","Then all income from capitalism and growing, and the concept of payload to over trade is completely covered."
963,"No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company  and those who work but do not own the company;  no more tug-of-war between capital and labor;  no great gap between investment and saving;  indeed, no towering twin peaks.","No business worth more in between the companies that work, but no employees, no longer the company, no longer has any major gap, and no longer the work of investment, no large sales among the apples."
964,"At the level of the global political economy,  imagine for a moment  that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate,  with a universal, global, digital currency,  one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund,  on behalf of all humanity.","In the midst of the global economics, what I want you to ask is that our national currency would have existed in a zoo, digital scum, from IMF, the WorldWide Telescope, and the things that in the entire world is given to 20s of humanity."
965,"And imagine further  that all international trade is denominated in this currency --  let's call it ""the cosmos,""  in units of cosmos --  with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund  a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit,  or indeed to a country's trade surplus.","Imagine that entire world will continue to be performed in this currency -- call it ""the co-proprismos"" -- in units of government -- and every government that pays the sum of the country, or the trade across the country, a common ground."
966,"And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies,  especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.","Imagine that this fund that technology is invested in green technologies, especially in the parts of the world, in the investment."
967,This is not a new idea.,That's not a new idea.
968,"It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed  in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.",It's basically what John Maynard was on Mayan in Ethicson from Bahamas.
969,"The problem is  that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.",The problem was you didn't have the technology to do it at the time.
970,"Now we do,  especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.","But we, particularly, have a background as a back story of politics and economics."
971,"The world that I am describing to you  is simultaneously libertarian,  in that it prioritizes empowered individuals,  Marxist,  since it will have confined to the dustbin of history  the division between capital and labor,  and Keynesian,  global Keynesian.","The world I write to you about, in the same sense, is to privileged people before privileged, and because they have buried in the buried of capitalists and work in the story of gestern, globalsiansian navigators."
972,"But above all else,  it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.","But above all, it's a world where we can imagine a real democracy."
973,Will such a world dawn?,We are awake at a world like this.
974,Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?,"Or will we be in ""The Iliatrinx,"" or something like that?"
975,The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.,The answer depends on how we choose together.
976,"It is our choice,  and we'd better make it democratically.","It is in our hands, and we do it better."
977,Thank you.,Thank you.
978,Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...,Bruno Giussani: Bruno's...
979,It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.,You describe yourself in your biodenture itself as a cosmologist.
980,What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?,How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
981,"Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said,  then Marx is relevant.","Yanis guys: If anything that I've just said, well, it's relevant."
982,"Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is --  if we don't do it,  then technological innovation is going to create  such a massive fall in aggregate demand,  what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.","And the reason that it's a policy block of politics and economic development is not, it's what we call the ""volent Truth,"" which is a holistic demand for the creation of issues."
983,"With this crisis migrating from one part of the world,  as it is now,  it will destabilize not only our democracies,  but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.","In this crisis, the transmission of one of the world, from one part of the next to where we're sitting, it's not only going to be deflect our wrongful product, but also the countries that are doing liberal democracy."
984,"So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.","If this analysis is soluble, it's Marx's relevant to that point."
985,"But so is Hayek,  that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,  and so is Keynes,  so that's why I'm totally confused.","So, as Haye, I'm also a supplementer, so I'm a Trinesia, and therefore we are totally totally with this."
986,"BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.","BG: And in fact, and now we're."
987,"YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?","Yy: If you're not up, you're not thinking enough."
988,"BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say --  YV: That was Einstein, actually --  BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China,  and last night at the speaker dinner,  you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China.","BG: That's a very Greek explanation, I think, kind of a philosophical explanation. In fact, it was -- in a Yi, you mentioned Snaing thing, and China was telling you that the speakers were very clear in your mind, which you did know, which is from the West."
989,Would you like to share that?,You want to repeat it again?
990,"YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.",Yeast: There's a big type of  Hemi get.
991,"In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.","In our liberal democracy, we have the democracy of a democracy."
992,"It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk,  democracy to the political sphere,  while leaving the one sphere where all the action is --  the economic sphere --  a completely democracy-free zone.","As I said earlier, we have the democracy in politics, while the most limited things in this field, which is totally democratized -- the area of economics."
993,"In a sense,  if I am allowed to be provocative,  China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.","In a way, I must say that, if I could say it was anything like that, China was today the 19th century of the 19th century."
994,"Because remember,  we tend to associate liberalism with democracy --  that's a mistake, historically.","Because -- remember, we tend to connect with a guy named democracy -- that's a mistaken."
995,"Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.","Liberals, Against, like John Stuart -- John."
996,John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.,he was especially skeptical about what was true in terms of a democratic development.
997,"So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process  to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution,  especially the transition from the first to the second.","Now what you see in China, you can see very similarly the evolution of the developing revolution in Britain, especially the transition from the first to the second."
998,"And to be castigating China  for doing that which the West did in the 19th century,  smacks of hypocrisy.","Now China is beginning to do what the West was doing in the 19th century, putting forward violently."
999,BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience  as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.,BG: I'm sure many people have a chance to read your experience as financial services in the beginning of the year.
1000,YV: I knew this was coming.,YYtech: I saw that's coming.
1001,BG: Yes.,BG: Yes...
1002,"BG: Six months after,  how do you look back at the first half of the year?",How long will you look back at the first half-year interval?
1003,"YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view,  and very disappointing,  because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone.","YV: Very exciting, I think, from a personal perspective, and very disappointed because we had the opportunity to make a new zone."
1004,"Not just Greece, the Eurozone.","Not only Greeks, but the Euroy zone."
1005,"To move away from the complacency  and the constant denial that there was a massive --  and there is a massive architectural fault line  going through the Eurozone,  which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.","And that is, to move from self-abillion randomness to the driver of the Europeans, to the Euroy of the European Union, and continue to increase the evolution of the European Union."
1006,We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program --  was the first program to manifest that denial --  to put it right.,"We had the opportunity to come up with the Greeks -- the first proposal, by the way, that was the one who caused this proposal."
1007,"And, unfortunately,  the powers in the Eurozone,  in the Eurogroup,  chose to maintain denial.","Unfortunately, it's right. Unfortunately, the mice in the Euro zone, continue to pick up the Euro group, really get the Multipsive."
1008,But you know what happens.,But you know what's coming.
1009,This is the experience of the Soviet Union.,This is the experience from the Soviet Union.
1010,"When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive,  through political will and through authoritarianism,  you may succeed in prolonging it,  but when change happens  it happens very abruptly and catastrophically.","But if you try to survive an economic system that's not able to survive, then perhaps be able to survive, and get out of a lifetime, you might be able to depend on a while, but when the change happens, and godsmish and kill you."
1011,BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?,BG: What change do you see in front of?
1012,"YV: Well, there's no doubt  that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone,  the Eurozone has no future.",Yy: There is no doubt that the future has no future when we don't change its future.
1013,BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?,BG: Have you ever been doing any mistakes in your time?
1014,YV: Every day.,Y: Every day.
1015,"BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back --    No, but seriously.","BG: For example? Everybody looking back, you know."
1016,"If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter,  who tells you after six months in a job,  especially in such a stressful situation,  that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people.","If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who, in particular, went to six months, did not have any mistakes, it's a dangerous mistake of person."
1017,Of course I made mistakes.,Of course I made mistakes.
1018,The greatest mistake was to sign the application  for the extension of a loan agreement  in the end of February.,The biggest mistake was to boost the billboards of the school curriculum.
1019,I was imagining  that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors  to find common ground.,I believed there was an honest interest to find a common solution to the money together.
1020,And there wasn't.,But that wasn't the case.
1021,"They were simply interested in crushing our government,  just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines  that were running through the Eurozone.",They just wanted to get our government to do so because they didn't want to employ the law and to come up with the Euros.
1022,And because they didn't want to admit  that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece.,They didn't want us to do this: they've been doing a disaster in Greek program in Greece for five years.
1023,We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.,We lost one-third of our GDP.
1024,This is worse than the Great Depression.,This is worse than the depression.
1025,"And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy  to say, ""This was a colossal mistake.""","No one in the theater, who kicked us on this policy, said, ""This is a sa Mediterranean."""
1026,"BG: Despite all this,  and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion,  you seem to be remaining quite pro-European.","BG: Despite all of that, and even despite the aggressive sound, you seem to be pretty hard at this point."
1027,YV: Absolutely.,Y: Absolutely.
1028,"Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone  comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe.",My critics the European Union and the Euro zone is based on somebody who lives and loved ones.
1029,My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.,My biggest fear is that the Euro zone is not alive.
1030,"Because if it doesn't,  the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed  and they will destroy the European Union.","Because if they do not survive, the local frogs will destroy hormones and the European Union."
1031,And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe  but for the whole global economy.,"That will not be a disaster for Europe, but for the entire economy as a whole."
1032,We are probably the largest economy in the world.,We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.
1033,"And if we allow ourselves  to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's,  which seems to me to be what we are doing,  then that will be detrimental  to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.","So even when we would think of the post-modern as 1930s, it seems to me that the European Union is also going to be the future for the European Union."
1034,BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.,BG: We hope you're very wrong in this point.
1035,"Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.",So thank you very much for coming to TED.
1036,YV: Thank you.,YYmen: Thank you.
1037,"Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about,  even though he may have been responsible  for 22 somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.","Roy sum: Probably the most likely thing, although he's probably going to be 22 minutes your life off the 19th of April Ruteria, April Ruk."
1038,"He may have also been responsible for 22 very entertaining minutes,  but not very many of you.","Probably somewhere under 22 minutes, I don't think so many of you."
1039,And all of that goes back to a decision  that Roy had to make about three years ago.,This is what comes back to the decision three years ago.
1040,"So you see, Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios.",Roy Roy-juggling is a high-security employee.
1041,That's the TV production company of Amazon.,Amazon is a company that we took of Amazon.
1042,"He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair,  describes himself on Twitter as ""movies, TV, technology, tacos.""","He's 47 years old, he's stent, and he describes a birds at Twitter when ""Filifil, technology."""
1043,"And Roy Price has a very responsible job, because it's his responsibility  to pick the shows, the original content that Amazon is going to make.","Roy has a very important job because he's responsible for describing the show and the content, and the content is going to produce the Amazon."
1044,And of course that's a highly competitive space.,"Of course, that's a very tough industry for business."
1045,"I mean, there are so many TV shows already out there,  that Roy can't just choose any show.",There are so many TV-industrial series that Roy can't steal any.
1046,"He has to find shows that are really, really great.","He has to find the show, the ones that are very, very good."
1047,"So in other words, he has to find shows  that are on the very right end of this curve here.","In other words, he's got to find the show that he's on the right."
1048,"So this curve here is the rating distribution  of about 2,500 TV shows on the website IMDB,  and the rating goes from one to 10,  and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating.","This curve is the Library of 2,500 TV series on the website -- the period, in IMDB. And the reader shows up to 10: many of these Standorts."
1049,"So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher, that's a winner.","We're advising your show with nine and higher, and that's the winner."
1050,Then you have a top two percent show.,Then you have a successful show.
1051,"That's shows like ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Wire,""  so all of these shows that are addictive,  whereafter you've watched a season, your brain is basically like,  ""Where can I get more of these episodes?""","These are the show like, ""What are the Hippo Bad Bad,"" like, ""The show are you making a show, where you just looked after, how are you going to do a chest pain, your brains?"""
1052,That kind of show.,This kind of show.
1053,"On the left side, just for clarity, here on that end,  you have a show called ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" --    -- which should tell you enough  about what's going on on that end of the curve.","On the left, there it's on the left, like ""Tohappiness"" -- this is what the ridge should tell you about, if you don't."
1054,"Now, Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve,  because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower  to undercut ""Toddlers and Tiaras.""","Roy Priceer don't care about the left-hand side because I think you need to have a special intelligence on the left-hand side, The Americanjobgencyclopedia."
1055,"So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here,  the bulge of average TV,  you know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad,  they don't really get you excited.","He's making more thoughts about the middle or the average television -- the show that's not bad, they're not missing."
1056,So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this.,So he's got to make sure he's really on the right side.
1057,"So the pressure is on, and of course it's also the first time  that Amazon is even doing something like this,  so Roy Price does not want to take any chances.","So the pressure is, of course, and it's also the first time that Amazon does something like this, so Roy doesn't want to risk it."
1058,He wants to engineer success.,He wants to create success.
1059,"He needs a guaranteed success,  and so what he does is, he holds a competition.","So it takes successes, so it holds a competition."
1060,"So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,  and from those ideas, through an evaluation,  they select eight candidates for TV shows,  and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows  and puts them online for free for everyone to watch.","He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and he went through an eight-ounce show, then he produced the first flat show, and produced the first article where anybody can look online and see it for free."
1061,"And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff, you're going to take it, right?","And if Amazon comes out for free, you may get right?"
1062,So millions of viewers are watching those episodes.,Millions of audience go up this round.
1063,"What they don't realize is that, while they're watching their shows,  actually, they are being watched.","But, as you know, they're not watching this show."
1064,"They are being watched by Roy Price and his team,  who record everything.",You'll watch Roy and his team at Roy.
1065,"They record when somebody presses play, when somebody presses pause,  what parts they skip, what parts they watch again.","They write the show when they start looking at the show, which one will check back at the other."
1066,"So they collect millions of data points,  because they want to have those data points  to then decide which show they should make.","They collect millions of data to decide what to do, and then to produce the show that they should produce."
1067,"And sure enough, so they collect all the data,  they do all the data crunching, and an answer emerges,  and the answer is,  ""Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators.""","In fact, they collect the data and it story and it raises the answer to that ""Am to another seven-dollar DVRs: a zoning election."""
1068,They did that show.,They were doing this show.
1069,So does anyone know the name of the show?,Anybody else out there?
1070,"Yes, ""Alpha House,""  but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually,  because it didn't turn out that great.","Yes, ""Sure."" But it doesn't seem that many people can remember this show, because she wasn't that good."
1071,"It's actually just an average show,  actually -- literally, in fact, because the average of this curve here is at 7.4,  and ""Alpha House"" lands at 7.5,  so a slightly above average show,  but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for.","It's just an average of the most average of the word -- in true of the words of this curve -- that's two-thirds and alpha House at 7,500 -- but something that worked on average, not on average, where Roy and his team works."
1072,"Meanwhile, however, at about the same time,  at another company,  another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis,  and his name is Ted,  Ted Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix,  and just like Roy, he's on a constant mission  to find that great TV show,  and he uses data as well to do that,  except he does it a little bit differently.","About the same time, another company, at a top of one company called Ted Sarandin, who is Ted Sarando's name, who is Ted Sarandos. Inside, who's using his group to find the Roy -- he's always on the data, he's using this super-stonic data, but he does something different."
1073,"So instead of holding a competition, what he did -- and his team of course --  was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers,  you know, the ratings they give their shows,  the viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on.","Instead of shooting a competition and being there are the team doing their data on the Netflix, so they're giving the basics, the practice, etc., etc."
1074,"And then they use that data to discover  all of these little bits and pieces about the audience:  what kinds of shows they like,  what kind of producers, what kind of actors.","And then they use this data to try and find out the little details about what the show are, what the producers they like, what's called the actors."
1075,"And once they had all of these pieces together,  they took a leap of faith,  and they decided to license  not a sitcom about four Senators  but a drama series about a single Senator.","So when they had all the parts of their nature, they decided to come together and they decided to give a decompress, not a Sitcoma, but a drama of a four-way series."
1076,You guys know the show?,You know that show?
1077,"Yes, ""House of Cards,"" and Netflix of course, nailed it with that show,  at least for the first two seasons.","Yes, it's -- A triangle helped this at least has a heat meeting for the first two American guys."
1078,"""House of Cards"" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve,  so it's exactly where they wanted it to be.","A fact that is often the Aravind security camera takes a buck in that curve, so they wanted to go where they wanted."
1079,"Now, the question of course is, what happened here?",So the question then is: what's going on?
1080,"So you have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.","You've got two very odd, data-driven companies."
1081,"They connect all of these millions of data points,  and then it works beautifully for one of them,  and it doesn't work for the other one.","They connect that data and it works for a lot of them, but it doesn't work for the other company."
1082,So why?,What's the point?
1083,Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time.,Because the logic somehow says it should work all with things.
1084,"I mean, if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make,  then you should be able to make a pretty good decision.","If you collect millions of data, for a decision you should make a good decision."
1085,You have 200 years of statistics to rely on.,You spend 200 years of statistics as a one-up.
1086,You're amplifying it with very powerful computers.,You're going to be able to make it very powerful by the computer.
1087,"The least you could expect is good TV, right?","That's nice, what you would expect, is it good television, right?"
1088,"And if data analysis does not work that way,  then it actually gets a little scary,  because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more  to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV.","When that data isn't working, it's a little more terrifying because we live in a time when we live in and more statistics to make more serious decisions about TV."
1089,Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?,Anybody know the company this multi-cam system?
1090,"No one. OK, that's good actually.","Nobody, OK. That's OK."
1091,"OK, so Multi-Health Systems is a software company,  and I hope that nobody here in this room  ever comes into contact with that software,  because if you do, it means you're in prison.","Multiply, a multi-task system is the software company, and I hope nobody in this room gets ever more touch with it. Come on in your prison."
1092,"If someone here in the US is in prison, and they apply for parole,  then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company  will be used in determining whether to grant that parole.","If anybody in the United States is here in the moment and  jeux, in fact, it's probably using data analysis to determine that this company is probably going to determine whether or not to determine whether an appeal is going to happen."
1093,"So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix,  but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad,  you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad.","Right like Amazon. But rather than having a show or a bad show, whether one is Mowives is going to be good or not."
1094,"And mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be pretty bad,  but more years in prison, I guess, even worse.","Central television, 22 minutes can be bad, but even more, it could be worse in jail."
1095,"And unfortunately, there is actually some evidence that this data analysis,  despite having lots of data, does not always produce optimum results.","Unfortunately, the evidence is that data uses a lot of data."
1096,And that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems  doesn't know what to do with data.,It's not always the best results. It's not because a company knows how to use multi-paraization.
1097,Even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong.,"The data is, again, the most fake companies."
1098,"Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.","Yeah, even Google makes mistakes."
1099,"In 2009, Google announced that they were able, with data analysis,  to predict outbreaks of influenza, the nasty kind of flu,  by doing data analysis on their Google searches.","In 2009, there's been data that they've had this really bad memory, that if you like, you can predict flu data, it's from Google, through Google analysis."
1100,"And it worked beautifully, and it made a big splash in the news,  including the pinnacle of scientific success: a publication in the journal ""Nature.""","It worked out a really wonderful news way, and it was a turning control of the line into a magazine called ""Nature."""
1101,"It worked beautifully for year after year after year,  until one year it failed.","This worked a liberation year after year, all the time, and it didn't work."
1102,And nobody could even tell exactly why.,and nobody could say why.
1103,"It just didn't work that year, and of course that again made big news,  of a publication from the journal ""Nature.""","It just wasn't working, which was once again a mustard presentation, including the cover of the book ""Nature."""
1104,"So even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google,  they sometimes get it wrong.",Even the most sophisticated data storage and Google sometimes misunderstood back.
1105,"And despite all those failures,  data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making --  into the workplace,  law enforcement,  medicine.","Despite all these mistakes in the decision of life, at the work of life, on a labor record, in medicine."
1106,So we should better make sure that data is helping.,And so we should think that data is helpful.
1107,"Now, personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself,  because I work in computational genetics,  which is also a field where lots of very smart people  are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions  like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug.","I'm also familiar with some data in the computer, and I'm working in the computer, at a very smart area where people can use some very smart decisions to make, like cancer therapy for a cancer."
1108,"And over the years, I've noticed a sort of pattern  or kind of rule, if you will, about the difference  between successful decision-making with data  and unsuccessful decision-making,  and I find this a pattern worth sharing, and it goes something like this.","Or this, or the evolution of a drug over the years, I've been looking at some patterns of data on successful decisions and not just campaigning. This pattern should be spread."
1109,"So whenever you're solving a complex problem,  you're doing essentially two things.","Do you ever want to solve a very complex problem, mainly two things."
1110,"The first one is, you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces  so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces,  You put all of these bits and pieces back together again  to come to your conclusion.","First, consider this problem in its parts: so that you can analyze the parts; you can analyze the parts; you can contrast the single pieces."
1111,"And sometimes you have to do it over again,  but it's always those two things:  taking apart and putting back together again.","Sometimes you have to do this again, but it's always two things: one, and put them together."
1112,And now the crucial thing is  that data and data analysis is only good for the first part.,And now the most important thing: data is only good for the first part.
1113,"Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful,  can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces.","Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful it can help to understand parts and its parts."
1114,It's not suited to put those pieces back together again  and then to come to a conclusion.,They're not engaged in putting together the pieces together and then bringing them back into the decision.
1115,"There's another tool that can do that, and we all have it, and that tool is the brain.","And there's another tool that's there, and we own it, that we all have our brains."
1116,"If there's one thing a brain is good at,  it's taking bits and pieces back together again,  even when you have incomplete information,  and coming to a good conclusion,  especially if it's the brain of an expert.","If there is something that's good in the brain to put it back together, it's also the information that's reasonably interchangeable -- especially when it's the brain is in a good brain."
1117,"And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful,  because they used data and brains where they belong in the process.",That's why I believe it was Netflix because they used data and understanding what they're hearing in the process.
1118,"They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience  that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth,  but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces  and put them back together again and make a show like ""House of Cards,""  that was nowhere in the data.","They're taking data to better understand what it would not have been, where they would not take the decision, but they would re-making a piece of decision together and actually turn it back into a piece of data that said, ""Do not be in the data."""
1119,"Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show,  which also meant, by the way, that they were taking  a pretty big personal risk with that decision.",Ted Sarando and his team made these decisions for what it meant was that they made a big personal risk on this decision.
1120,"And Amazon, on the other hand, they did it the wrong way around.",Amazons were doing it in the wrong way.
1121,"They used data all the way to drive their decision-making,  first when they held their competition of TV ideas,  then when they selected ""Alpha House"" to make as a show.","They used data to make all their decisions first, first they took TV shows as ""happy"" television."
1122,"Which of course was a very safe decision for them,  because they could always point at the data, saying,  ""This is what the data tells us.""","It was a safe decision, because they could always say, ""Well, we're the data."""
1123,But it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for.,It didn't lead to results.
1124,"So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions,  but I believe that things go wrong  when data is starting to drive those decisions.","Data is useful for better decisions, but I believe that things are going wrong when we start doing our decision-making data."
1125,"No matter how powerful, data is just a tool,  and to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful.","Either way it's powerful, data is just a tool, and to not forget that instrument."
1126,Many of you will ...,Thank you very much.
1127,"Before there was data,  this was the decision-making device to use.","Before that, this was the device for decisions."
1128,Many of you will know this.,Many know it.
1129,"This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball,  and it's really amazing,  because if you have a decision to make, a yes or no question,  all you have to do is you shake the ball, and then you get an answer --  ""Most Likely"" -- right here in this window in real time.","It's also called anMagic ball every eight Balle, or an amazing decision, for the ball game, all you need to do is to shake the ballrooms, and probably get an answer."
1130,I'll have it out later for tech demos.,I'll end with a technique from a techno.
1131,"Now, the thing is, of course -- so I've made some decisions in my life  where, in hindsight, I should have just listened to the ball.","I've met a couple of decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball."
1132,"But, you know, of course, if you have the data available,  you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated,  like data analysis to come to a better decision.","But, of course, as you know, if you want to have the data available, you'd like to put a little more Eingang data analysis, to make better decisions."
1133,But that does not change the basic setup.,But it doesn't change the way we start building.
1134,"So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter,  but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions  if we want to achieve something extraordinary, on the right end of the curve.","So maybe the ball of the balloon is really smart and clever, it will ultimately make us feel if we're going to reach a little extraordinary curve."
1135,"And I find that a very encouraging message, in fact,  that even in the face of huge amounts of data,  it still pays off to make decisions,  to be an expert in what you're doing  and take risks.","And I feel that as a very daunting news editor, that actually despite the fact that it's still a to make decisions, a expert in what you do, and putting a risks to your risks."
1136,"Because in the end, it's not data,  it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve.","Because it's not the data, it's the risks you have on the right-hand side of the curves."
1137,Thank you.,Thank you.
