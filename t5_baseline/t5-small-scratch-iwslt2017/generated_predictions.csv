0,So this is James Risen.,That's James Rises.
1,You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter  for The New York Times.,You may know it because it won the New York CityTime re-engineering owner.
2,"Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name,  Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed  that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.","For a long time, before anybody's heard of Snow, he wrote a book that he published spectacular, that the adult phones had stopped illegal phones from America."
3,But it's another chapter in that book  that may have an even more lasting impact.,But it's another chapter that should leave a sexy impression behind it.
4,"In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation  in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints  of a nuclear bomb to Iran.",He describes a catastrophic local U.S. secret surgery where Iran literally grew up in a nuclear bomb for a nuclear weapon.
5,"If that sounds crazy, go read it.","If that sounds crazy, read it."
6,It's an incredible story.,It's an incredible story.
7,But you know who didn't like that chapter?,"But you know, who didn't like the chapter at all?"
8,The US government.,U.S. government administration.
9,"For nearly a decade afterwards,  Risen was the subject of a US government investigation  in which prosecutors demanded that he testify  against one of his alleged sources.","Almost 10 years, government has been able to draw the government against Rise and asked him to use its mental sources."
10,"And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern  of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.","In this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, Whisblowers and journalists."
11,"You see, under the First Amendment,  the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.",And the first thing is that the media has the right to publish secret information.
12,But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news  and protect the identities of the brave men and women  who get it to them.,But it's impossible to apply that right to media if that information doesn't get information and if they can't protect identity that they're surrounded by.
13,"So when the government came knocking,  Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him:  he refused  and said he'd rather go to jail.","So when the government arrived at Risearyt, he did something that a lot of brave reporters had already done before him: he would rather be crying, and he would rather walk in jail."
14,"So from 2007 to 2015,  Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.","So from 2007, to 2015 Rise lived with risk where prison was going."
15,"That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.","But then only days before the process, something extraordinary happened."
16,"Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case,  the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.","Suddenly, even though they gave years more reliable for their case, the researchers were emitted to do it."
17,"It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance,  there are very few places reporters and sources can hide.",The reason: in the time electronic growth can hide the reporter and sources and a few times.
18,"And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify,  they could have his digital trail testify against him instead.","Instead of putting their digital foot and Riseing to the statement, it could also do this with its digital foot for him."
19,"So completely in secret and without his consent,  prosecutors got Risen's phone records.","And so the programs, without his averständnis, has secret to his telephone."
20,"They got his email records, his financial and banking information,  his credit reports,  even travel records with a list of flights he had taken.","It's as much as it's got to -- financial information and bank information, its loan, and even travel to the list of its wings."
21,"And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,  Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.","In the middle of this information, they found evidence that they used to CIA Sterling, a CIAist and Rise sources of Riseing."
22,"Sadly, this is only one case of many.","Unfortunately, it's just one of many cases."
23,"President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers,  and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more  than all other administrations combined.","President Obama talked to protect Whisnblobs, but instead, the convicted of convicted of convicted of all of American government had gone up to him."
24,"Now, you can see how this could be a problem,  especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.","Now, you can imagine how this could be a problem, especially because the government of work was secretly turned into a secret."
25,"Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security  has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.","Since 9/11, almost every article on national security has been about the result that a Whirblower went to a journalist."
26,So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job  that the First Amendment is supposed to protect  because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.,"So we're putting the press on play, which is to protected through the first explosion, because the government has more and more opportunities to put everyone out."
27,"But just as technology has allowed the government  to circumvent reporters' rights,  the press can also use technology  to protect their sources even better than before.","But just as much as technology allows government to avoid the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better."
28,"And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them,  rather than on the witness stand after the fact.","And that's the moment they can take that off, instead of having your contact, rather than when they're in the stuff."
29,"Communications software now exists  that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book,  and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.","Today there's communication software that haven't been written as Rise's book, and it's a lot more safe than normal email or phone calls."
30,"For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,  an open-source whistleblower submission system  that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,  and is now developed at the non-profit where I work,  Freedom of the Press Foundation.","One of the technologies is geo-engineerroprop, an open-source system for Whisblower, which was taken by the Internet blob of us, was developed by Aaron Swartz, and is now by the Freedom of the press Foundation that I work with."
31,"Instead of sending an email,  you go to a news organization's website,  like this one here on The Washington Post.","Instead of sending an email, go to a message set, like the Washington Post."
32,"From there, you can upload a document or send information  much like you would on any other contact form.","And you can send documents up or information, like you can get at any ordinary contact."
33,It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server  that only the news organization has access to.,"And they're then putting them together, and on a servers, to the only message that's ever gotten access to the news set."
34,"So the government can no longer secretly demand the information,  and much of the information they would demand  wouldn't be available in the first place.","So the government can't really get more information, and many of the information that it would challenge them to do would not be available from ahead."
35,"SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle  for protecting press freedom in the 21st century.","But consciousnessroprop is just a small part of the whole, to protect press press in the 21st century."
36,"Unfortunately, governments all over the world  are constantly developing new spying techniques  that put us all at risk.",Unfortunately governments around the world are always developing new squatter technologies that are all endangered.
37,"And it's up to us going forward to make sure  that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers,  like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.","It's safe to make sure that not just technology know how Edward Snow did a possibility to bring Miss Snows, it's as important that we protect the next Whirlwind in time."
38,"It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower  alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,  or the next environmental worker  sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water,  or a Wall Street insider  warning us of the next financial crisis.","The tiniading of soldiers knows about the two-way hospitals, or the next environmental worker who takes a tinkering home for Flint -- or Wall Street, who warns us from the next financial crisis."
39,"After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women  who expose crimes,  but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.","After all, these technologies were not only done for those who want to cover crime, but to protect our very rights of all."
40,Thank you.,Thank you.
41,"[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.]  [The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people]  [hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.]  [What does this mean?]  [We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]  This week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories  coming out from the leak of 11 million documents  from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.","[Am 3.14 2016] [The largest data published the story.] [The ""The theft and M.P.] [S.] [When have slammograms in the copy shit.] [When have we asked the money to do this?] [We asked Robert Palmer a week by Global Palmer, we got a news million people about a news documents of fada lawyer frog's frog's in Panama frog."
42,The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece  of the secretive offshore world.,The publication of these documents is actually a little bit of a small view of the secret world of tax.
43,"We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers  go to companies like Mossack Fonseca  and say, ""OK, we want an anonymous company,  can you give us one?""","We get a sense of how clients and banks and rightel companies like Mossacks, frog's and say, ""Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you do that?"""
44,"So you actually get to see the emails,  you get to see the exchanges of messages,  you get to see the mechanics of how this works,  how this operates.","We actually see the email that exchange of news, like the whole system works like it works."
45,"Now, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.",This already led to the first very direct consequences.
46,The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.,Islands Prime Minister is back.
47,We've also had news  that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad  has also got offshore companies.,"Also, there is a report that a brutal diet of brutality base of Basin's worst-plus letter has been a taxation."
48,"There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail  that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia  via his close childhood friend,  who happens to be a top cellist.","It's said that a trace of 2 billion dollars in Russia's president lead to Russia Wladimir Putin, versus a friend of children, a famous cellist."
49,And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there  and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories  and the next set of leaked documents.,"Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervous in the next publication, and on the next higher document."
50,"Now, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller  or a John Grisham novel.",Now this sounds like the tinial pymah or a John-grisham-like ad.
51,"It seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.","It seems to be crying from you, ordinary people."
52,Why should we care about this?,Why would we do that?
53,"But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals  are able to keep their money offshore  and not pay the taxes that they should,  it means that there is less money for vital public services  like healthcare, education, roads.","But the truth is, if the rich and powerful able to put their wealth into tax levels, not all pay off their tax, it means less money for important public services like health services, education."
54,And that affects all of us.,And that's what we're all concerned with.
55,"Now, for my organization Global Witness,  this exposé has been phenomenal.","For my organization, global, Witness, these are the Enthic phenomena."
56,We have the world's media and political leaders  talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy  to hide and disguise their assets --  something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.,"In all the world, media and politicians are putting together, like secret taxes, are used to hide some of the things that are used to happen, to reduce their wealth -- something that we've been able to discuss for 10 years and ethnicize."
57,"Now, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing,  and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.","I think a lot of people think the whole world is very confused, and it's hard to understand how these taxes are working."
58,I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.,I always think of it like a rjoking.
59,"So you can have one company stacked inside another company,  stacked inside another company,  making it almost impossible to really understand  who is behind these structures.","So you have a company in another company, which is almost impossible to understand who's behind these forms."
60,"It can be very difficult for law enforcement  or tax authorities, journalists, civil society  to really understand what's going on.","It can be very difficult for being a ticket and tax-minded, and for journalists or to really understand civil society, what's the thing."
61,I also think it's interesting  that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.,I think it's also interesting that there are less reports in the United States than that.
62,"And that's perhaps because some prominent US people  just haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.","Because, of course, there were no prominent Americans who were in this Enthic, this sculpture came out."
63,"Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans  who are stashing their assets offshore.","Now, it's not like that there's no rich American who are putting their wealth into taxoaseing."
64,"It's just because of the way in which offshore works,  Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.","But by the principle, after that taxoase, Mossackon fseca less American customers working."
65,"I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands  or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada,  you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.","If we had a piece of data from Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that connect the connections in the U.S."
66,"In fact, in a number of US states you need less information,  you need to provide less information to get a company  than you do to get a library card.","In fact, it's so much less information you need in some U.S., less information to give you less information to create a company than they can know a library."
67,That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts  to rip off schoolchildren.,This kind of broader type in the United States has allowed school employees to enlist school children.
68,It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.,It allows concrete to end especially in randomness.
69,This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.,It's this kind of behavior that's happening all of us.
70,"Now, at Global Witness,  we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.","So here in global Witness, we wanted to figure out what all this looks like in practice."
71,How does this actually work?,How does this actually work?
72,So what we did  is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.,So we sent a discovery in the office of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan.
73,"Our investigator posed as an African minister  who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States  to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.","Our lesson was that when African ministers wanted to get money in the United States to buy a house, a squat of desire to buy a private Soviet."
74,"Now, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers  provided our investigator with suggestions  on how to move those suspect funds.",We really shocked it all the way to an lawyer does our experience as he could make money.
75,"These were all preliminary meetings,  and none of the lawyers took us on as a client  and of course no money moved hands,  but it really shows the problem with the system.","These were all pre-doughs. None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was surrounded with money, but it shows the problem with this system."
76,It's also important  to not just think about this as individual cases.,It's also important to think of this as individuals.
77,This is not just about an individual lawyer  who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.,It's not about a single lawyer who's spreads in our covered beam.
78,It's not just about a particular senior politician  who's been caught up in a scandal.,"It's not about a single tipping policy, turning into a scandal."
79,"This is about how a system works,  that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.","It's about how the system works, by corruption, taxation, poverty and instability."
80,"And in order to tackle this,  we need to change the game.","And to cope with that, we have to change the game."
81,We need to change the rules of the game  to make this sort of behavior harder.,We need to change the rules to make these kinds of behaviors happen.
82,"This may seem like doom and gloom,  like there's nothing we can do about it,  like nothing has ever changed,  like there will always be rich and powerful individuals.","This may seem very obated, as though we could not do anything about it; as though there's always going to be the rich and the richness."
83,"But as a natural optimist,  I do see that we are starting to get some change.",But as a optimism I see through the fact that there's a lot of stuff happening.
84,"Over the last couple of years,  we've seen a real push towards greater transparency  when it comes to company ownership.","We've seen more transparency years ago, which is true for the owner of companies."
85,This issue was put on the political agenda  by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron  at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013.,The theme of the British prime ministers found David Cameron on the G8i apple in Northern Ireland.
86,"And since then, the European Union is going to be creating  central registers at a national level  of who really owns and controls companies across Europe.","Since then, the E.U. has been able to do with central feet at a national level, who really put our companies in Europe, and who controls them."
87,"One of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.",One of the things that is insecure is that the United States is going to go after that.
88,"There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced  in the House and the Senate,  but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.","And both parties have brought a laws into both parliament chambers, but this is not the progress that we'd like to see."
89,"So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks,  this huge peek into the offshore world,  be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.","We would really like to see how this Panamathic, this giant glimpse of the world's tax taxation is used as a means to worry about transparence in the United States and global transparency."
90,"For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.","For us, globalization is a moment for change."
91,We need ordinary people to get angry  at the way in which people can hide their identity  behind secret companies.,We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity.
92,"We need business leaders to stand up and say,  ""Secrecy like this is not good for business.""","We need leaders in business, who stand up and say, ""We're not good for business."""
93,"We need political leaders to recognize the problem,  and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.",We need politicians who recognize the problem and replace it by laws of reducing these kinds of inflection.
94,"Together, we can end the secrecy  that is currently allowing tax evasion,  corruption, money laundering to flourish.","We can zoom in on the dragged, which is now a kind of taxation of taxation, corruption, and make money laundering finally."
95,I want to tell you the story  about the time I almost got kidnapped  in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.,"That's the story I did almost do, and in the suitcase of a red Mazda."
96,It's the day after graduating from design school  and I'm having a yard sale.,"One day after I finished my design school, I made a back-of-the-box."
97,And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda  and he starts looking through my stuff.,"A guy in the red Mazda stayed there, and he looked at my things."
98,And he buys a piece of art that I made.,He bought one of my artworks.
99,"And it turns out he's alone in town for the night,  driving cross-country on a road trip  before he goes into the Peace Corps.","He was alone in the city, and he was making a road trip across the entire country, and then he would go to peacekeepers."
100,So I invite him out for a beer  and he tells me all about his passion  for making a difference in the world.,I invited him to a beer. He told me how he wanted to change the world.
101,"Now it's starting to get late,  and I'm getting pretty tired.",It was late. I was a tired.
102,"As I motion for the tab,  I make the mistake of asking him,  ""So where are you staying tonight?""","While we paid the calculation, I made the mistakes to ask him, ""Where are you going to sleep at night?"""
103,"And he makes it worse by saying,  ""Actually, I don't have a place.""","He did the whole thing worse: ""I don't know yet."""
104,"And I'm thinking, ""Oh, man!""","And I thought, ""Oh, man!"
105,What do you do?,"So what do I do?"""
106,"We've all been there, right?",Who don't know the situation?
107,Do I offer to host this guy?,I now had to offer a sleep in sleep?
108,"But, I just met him -- I mean,  he says he's going to the Peace Corps,  but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps  and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.","But I just met him. He said, he would go to peace, but I don't know if he really want to land this in a suitcase room."
109,That's a small trunk!,This is a little squatter room.
110,"So then I hear myself saying,  ""Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room.""","Then I heard myself saying, ""I've got an airt. You can sleep in my living room."""
111,"And the voice in my head goes,  ""Wait, what?""","A voice in my head said, ""Are you?"""
112,"That night, I'm laying in bed,  I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,  ""Oh my god, what have I done?","And at night I was in bed, I died the ceiling and I thought, ""Oh, man! What did I dry up there?"
113,There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.,A wild aliens in my living room.
114,"What if he's psychotic?""","What if he's crazy?"""
115,"My anxiety grows so much,  I leap out of bed,  I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,  and I lock the bedroom door.","I got a fear that I got out of bed, up on the door, sat down on the door, and then I decided to have my bedroom door."
116,It turns out he was not psychotic.,But he wasn't crazy.
117,We've kept in touch ever since.,We're still in contact.
118,And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale  is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.,"The art, the piece that he bought from me was in his classroom today. He's now teachers."
119,"This was my first hosting experience,  and it completely changed my perspective.",This was my first experience as a Gastgeber. It changed my perspective completely.
120,Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers  were actually friends waiting to be discovered.,"Maybe the people who sold me in childhood were actually sold as foreign, actually, friends who were waiting to be discovered?"
121,"The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me  and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.","People on my air dissent, normal to me, when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air damage."
122,So now it's two years later.,"Let's take a leap, two years later..."

124,"And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town,  and all the hotels are sold out.","I learned that there was a design conference in the city, all hotels were made of."
125,And I've always believed that turning fear into fun  is the gift of creativity.,I think creativity can make it fear of fun.
126,"So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky:  ""Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks --  turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,'  offering young designers who come to town a place to crash,  complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space,  sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.","I wrote my best friend and new compassion in Brian Chesky: ""Brian, I thought we could make something like our apartment, our designer-and-a-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half ink, diabetes-a-half in the morning, including a Matr."

133,Did we just discover it was possible to make friends  while also making rent?,Are we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?

136,And we buckled down to see  if we could turn this into a business.,We wanted to find out if you could make a business conceptual tool out of it.

145,"Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know,  and all we really knew was design.","If you've got a problem, you're focusing on things that you can do well. We could design."
146,"In art school, you learn that design is much more  than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.","At the art ofaka, we learned that design is much more than just looking and Hapamine -- it's the total experience."
147,"We learned to do that for objects,  but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust  between people who had never met.","We've learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create huge trust between people who had never met before."
148,Could design make that happen?,Can design do this?

158,"People don't just see your messages,  they see your bedroom,  your kitchen, your toilet.","You can't just read your text, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."

421,It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.,It's a aircraft aircraft trying to beat two flies with a force.
422,"Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight,  much more so than helicopters and variations thereof.","As other stars are in front of it, in the flight, far more efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all of their variations."

426,We're developing new control architectures and algorithms  that address this limitation.,We're developing new taxities and algorithms to improve this.
427,"The idea is for the aircraft to recover  no matter what state it finds itself in,  and through practice, improve its performance over time.","The idea is that the flight device doesn't matter what the optimal position can be improved, and it can be improved by evil."
428,OK.,Okay.
429,"When doing research,  we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions  that try to get at the heart of a matter.","As we often ask ourselves, we're very fundamentally asking the key questions about the core of the thing."
430,"For example, one such question would be,  what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?","So, for example, would be a question like this: what is the small impossible number of things to controlled parts?"

438,"Even though it's mechanically simple,  there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain  to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.","Although it's mechanically simple, in interior life, so it can stable it, and move around in the room all over the place."
439,"Even so, it doesn't yet have  the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter,  which means that in order to get it to fly,  I have to throw it just right.","Yet it doesn't really mean it about the elegant algorithm in the squirt algorithm, so to fly it, I have to throw it right."
440,"And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low,  given everybody watching me,  what we're going to do instead  is show you a video that we shot last night.","The probability of suck it right to see me, is humbling, so I'm going to show you a video that was filmed last night."

491,"Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction!   Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes,  a theoretical physicist at MIT,  who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes  and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO,  So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.","All that I've been working for, which is no longer science fiction -- AA's had a very good friend, AA and Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at MIT, looked at gravity for 23 years, where they've been looking at gravity and their observaal signals like LIGO signals, but what are gravity?"
492,A gravitational wave is a ripple  in the shape of space and time.,A gravitational wave is a sound in the midst of space and time.
493,"As the wave passes by,  it stretches space and everything in it  in one direction,  and compresses it in the other.","And then, as we move across the wave of space and its entire content, we're going to have to go into a direction and re-eyed space."
494,This has led to countless instructors of general relativity  doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.,"There's a lot of talk about dopamine in course, with relativity, to relativity, often a silly dance."
495,"""It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands.""","""Deuld and dive, deplete and come."""
496,So the trouble with gravitational waves  is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.,"The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely affordable, even ridiculous."
497,"For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 --  and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed  under the action of that wave --  when the waves hit, they stretched the average person  by one part in 10 to the 21.","On 14 14th, for example, every one of us was raised on the waves and stolen the average person, and the average person was wore 10 to three."
498,"That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,  That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.","That means 20 zeros after the community, followed by a Dar Dar explains the chance for crazy."
499,Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy --  they would have to measure the length of those detectors  to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus  of an atom.,"With a five-mile laser, and that's absurd, it has to be already less than a thousand-inch atomic-like atom. That's a big deal."
500,And that's preposterous.,"At the end of his classic text, gravity goes across."
501,"So towards the end of his classic text on gravity,  described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows:  He said, ""The technical difficulties to be surmounted  in constructing such detectors are enormous.","And I described Kip Thors, a compassion LI re-eyed community, who said, ""The way to treat these technological problems are enormously violent."

506,"Visible light has a wavelength, a size,  that's much smaller than the things around you,  the features on people's faces,  the size of your cell phone.","And the kind of light has a wavelength that's much smaller than the things around us: face suits, the size of your cell phone."
507,"And that's really useful,  because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you,  by looking at the light coming from different spots  in the scene about you.","That's quite practical, because you can make a picture or a map of things by coming out of several points of light around you."
508,Sound is different.,It's different in sound.
509,Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.,Listening sound has a wavelength of about 15 meters.
510,"And that makes it really difficult --  in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image  of something you really care about.","So, it's very hard to actually make an image of things that tell you very much."
511,Your child's face.,The face of your child is about.
512,"Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch  and tone and rhythm and volume  to infer a story behind the sounds.","Instead, we're laughing at certain traits like clay and Italy, rhythm and loud, to close that story down."

516,"So, the same is true of gravitational waves.",Same thing for gravitational waves.
517,We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.,We can't make them simple pictures of objects in space.
518,"But by listening to changes  in the amplitude and frequency of those waves,  we can hear the story that those waves are telling.","But by looking at changes in the '60s and writing frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."
519,"And at least for LIGO,  the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.",At least for LIGO measured the frequency of the listen.
520,"So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound,  we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.","So if we turn waves into sound, we can literally hear the whole thing."
521,"For example, listening to gravity, just in this way,  can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes,  something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.",The gravitational can tell us about the collision two about the collisions of black holes where my colleague is going on Scott for a long time.
522,"SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop!","SH: Two black, not sludge, just suck."
523,"If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp,  but with a modulation on top of it,  so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!","The two bodies very quickly, you heard the same quote with an extra clay, and it sounds like that:w-wo-wp-wo-w."
524,It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.,"It's a kind of a motion-based, spit into the waves."
525,"AA: So on September 14, 2015,  a date that's definitely going to live in my memory,  LIGO heard this:  [Whirring sound]  So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --   SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses,  that were whirling around at a rate  comparable to what goes on in your blender.","AA: On September 14 14th of September -- one of my date -- at least I never forget -- the sounds of law, the sound knows what it's like -- SHcening, recognizes it as sound -- SHing from -- SHers from any black holes -- from any black holes that are about as fast as the tribes are doing."
526,AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.,AA: Let's think about what that means.
527,"Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe,  one with a mass of 29 Suns  and one with a mass of 36 Suns,  whirling around each other 100 times per second  before they collide.","Two black holes that are interconnections in space with a mass of 29 sun, a mass of mass of 36 times a second, whereas hundreds of times a second before they work."

794,Thank you.,Thank you.
795,So I'm a neurosurgeon.,I'm a neurosurgeon.
796,"And like most of my colleagues,  I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.",As most of my colleagues have been able to do with human tragedy every day.
797,I realize how your life can change from one second to the other  after a major stroke or after a car accident.,"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke, or a car accident."
798,"And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons  is to realize that unlike other organs of the body,  the brain has very little ability for self-repair.","For us neurosurgeon, it's very frustrating for us to find that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small skill to heal itself."
799,"And after a major injury of your central nervous system,  the patients often remain with a severe handicap.","After a heavy injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a sexy disability."
800,And that's probably the reason why I've chosen  to be a functional neurosurgeon.,That's why I became functional neurosin.
801,What is a functional neurosurgeon?,What's a functional neurosurgeon?
802,It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function  through different surgical strategies.,A doctor who is trying to improve neurons through different surgical things.
803,"You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones  called deep brain stimulation,  where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain  in order to modulate a circuit of neurons  to improve a neurological function.","Certainly, they've heard about one of the most famous brain systems called ""Tietulation,"" which is implanted by an electron in the brain to influence the circuitry of neurons so that the neurologic function improves."
804,"It's really an amazing technology  in that it has improved the destiny of patients  with Parkinson's disease,  with severe tremor, with severe pain.",It's really an amazing technology. It's improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's patients who have suffered under a scuba divers and heavy pain.
805,"However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.",But neuroscientation means not neurology.
806,And the dream of functional neurosurgeons  is to repair the brain.,The dream function of neurosurgeon is the re-constructive of the brain.
807,I think  that we are approaching this dream.,And I think we're closer to that dream.
808,And I would like to show you  that we are very close to this.,I want to show you that we're very close to it.
809,"And that with a little bit of help,  the brain is able to help itself.","With some help, the brain can help themselves."
810,So the story started 15 years ago.,The stories started 15 years ago.
811,"At that time, I was a chief resident  working days and nights in the emergency room.",At the time I was a senior and worked day and night in the emergency room.
812,I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.,I often figured out what I did with patients with skull-like room.
813,"You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma,  his brain is swelling  and he's increasing his intracranial pressure.","You have to imagine, with skull rocks, the brain is getting excited and sludge over."
814,"And in order to save his life,  you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.","To save life, you have to fight your skull."
815,you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.,You have to sometimes remove a snucky brain mass sometimes.
816,"So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain,  we decided with Jean-François Brunet,  who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,  to study them.","Instead of sneoseating the swollen of the brain, we decided to start with jeans well-being, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze brain mass."
817,What do I mean by that?,What do I mean by that?
818,We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.,We wanted to grow cells out of that tissue.
819,It's not an easy task.,That's not a easy task.
820,Growing cells from a piece of tissue  is a bit the same as growing very small children  out from their family.,"If you grow up from a tissue piece of tissue, it's equivalent to a very small kids that come out of your families."
821,"So you need to find the right nutrients,  the warmth, the humidity  and all the nice environments to make them thrive.","You have to have the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to let them go."
822,So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.,And that's exactly what we needed to do with these cells.
823,"And after many attempts,  Jean-François did it.","After many attempt, jeans grew."
824,And that's what he saw under his microscope.,This is what he saw under his microscope.
825,"And that was, for us, a major surprise.",That was a big surprise for us.
826,Why?,Why?
827,"Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture,  with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.","It looked like a stem cell culture, with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unsustainable cells."
828,"And you may remember from biology class  that stem cells are immature cells,  able to turn into any type of cell of the body.","You may know from biology science, that stem cells are able to turn cells into each cell type of organism."
829,"The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare  and they're located in deep and small niches  in the depths of the brain.","The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They're in deep, little nutrients of the brain."
830,So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture  from the superficial part of swollen brain we had  in the operating theater.,It's surprising to get these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue in the brain of surgery.
831,"And there was another intriguing observation:  Regular stem cells are very active cells --  cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.",We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.
832,"And they never die, they're immortal cells.",They never die; they're unsterable.
833,But these cells behave differently.,But these cells were devoted to each other.
834,"They divide slowly,  and after a few weeks of culture,  they even died.",They were slowly divided and they died after a few weeks.
835,So we were in front of a strange new cell population  that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.,"So we saw a new, odd cell population, which looked like stem cells looked like, but differently grew."
836,And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.,We needed a long time to understand where they came from.
837,They come from these cells.,You're going to take you from these cells.
838,These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.,These blue and red cells are called  Doublecortin-positive cells.
839,All of you have them in your brain.,We all have it in our brains.
840,They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.,They make four percent of our brain cells out of the world.
841,They have a very important role during the development stage.,They are playing a very important role in our development.
842,"When you were fetuses,  they helped your brain to fold itself.","At the stage of the axe, it's worried about the fold of the brain."
843,But why do they stay in your head?,But why do they stay alive?
844,"This, we don't know.",We don't know.
845,We think that they may participate in brain repair  because we find them in higher concentration  close to brain lesions.,We believe they're part of the healing brain because we're finding them in higher concentrations of brain restaurants.
846,But it's not so sure.,But that's not that safe.
847,"But there is one clear thing --  that from these cells,  we got our stem cell culture.","But one thing is clear -- of these cells, we got our stem cells."
848,And we were in front of a potential new source of cells  to repair the brain.,We're in front of an potential cell source that allows brain to heal.
849,And we had to prove this.,We had to prove that.
850,we decided to design an experimental paradigm.,So we decided to develop an experiment.
851,"The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain  in a non-eloquent area of the brain,  and then to culture the cells  exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.","We wanted to take a piece of brain out of not a single area, and then pull the cells out exactly the same way that jeans did."
852,"And then label them, to put color in them  in order to be able to track them in the brain.",And they are unable to mark them in the brain.
853,And the last step was to re-implant them  in the same individual.,We've been taking it to the same individual over the same stage.
854,We call these  autologous grafts -- autografts.,We call the autoologist transplantation -- car transplantation.
855,"So the first question we had,  ""What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain,  and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells  in a lesioned brain?""","One of the first questions we did was, what happens when we put these cells in normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we put the same cells in damaged brain?"
856,"Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller,  we worked with monkeys.","Thank you very much for a help from the help of Profy, Eric routines we could work with monkeys."
857,"So in the first-case scenario,  we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain  and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks,  as if they were taken from the brain,  they go back home,  the space is already busy,  they are not needed there, so they disappear.","The first scenario we put in a healthy brain, and we see that they were completely disappeared for weeks, when they were re-intentioned, they go back home. The room is already sat down, so they won't go away."
858,"In the second-case scenario,  we performed the lesion,  we re-implanted exactly the same cells,  and in this case, the cells remained --  and they became mature neurons.","The second scenario, we put in a injury, and we re-construct the same cells, and now the cells are remained the cells -- they grew up to neurons."
859,And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.,Here you see what we saw under the microscope.
860,Those are the cells that were re-implanted.,These are the cells that have been re-resolution.
861,"And the proof they carry,  these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled  in vitro, when they were in culture.","The evidence they show are these little dots. These are the cells that we face in vitro, in culture."
862,"But we could not stop here, of course.","And of course, we couldn't stop there."
863,Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?,Do these cells help you get from a monkey to catch up from a brain.
864,"So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.",So we trained monkeys with a manualnessness.
865,They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.,They had to take food from a tray.
866,They were very good at it.,They did very good.
867,"And when they had reached a plateau of performance,  we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.","When they reached a stable level of economic level, we'd be able to do motor cortex in the motor Cormoto factory."
868,"So the monkeys were plegic,  they could not move their hand anymore.","And so the monkeys were paralyzed, and they couldn't move their hand anymore."
869,"And exactly the same as humans would do,  they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent,  exactly the same as after a stroke.","And just as it would happen in humans, they would spontaneously slow down to some degree, just like a stroke."
870,"Patients are completely plegic,  and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism,  they recover to a certain extent,  exactly the same for the monkey.","The patients are paralyzed, and then they try to bring themselves with plastic mechanisms, and they get in some degree, just like the monkeys."
871,"So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau  of spontaneous recovery,  we implanted his own cells.","When we were sure that the monkey had reached the spontaneous recovery, we put his own cells on the ground."
872,"So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.",On the left you see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.
873,He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance  before the lesion.,It can bring about 40 percent of its original performance from injury to 50 percent.
874,"He's not so accurate, not so quick.",It's not that precise and it's not so fast.
875,"And look now, when we re-impant the cells:  Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.","Now, look at the cells that we've been re-construct: the same monkey, two months after reimplantation."
876,"It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.","I can tell you, these were also very exciting for us."
877,"Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.","Since that time, we've found a lot more about these cells."
878,"We know that we can cryopreserve them,  we can use them later on.",We can engineer them and use later.
879,"We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models,  like Parkinson's disease, for example.","We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example, in Parkinson's disease."
880,But our dream is still to implant them in humans.,"But our dream is still, in people's dream, to implant it."
881,And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon  that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.,"I really hope that, soon, I'll show you how the human brain gives you the tools to heal itself."
882,Thank you.,Thank you very much.
883,"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,  and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience,  possibly even a majority,  who are thinking, ""I know somebody who can use this.""","Bruno Giussani: Jocenelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps the majority, think, ""I know someone who needs that."""
884,"I do, in any case.",I'm definitely.
885,"And of course the question is,  what are the biggest obstacles  before you can go into human clinical trials?","Of course, the question is, what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on the people."
886,"Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations.   So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out  about two kilograms of papers and forms  to be able to go through these kind of trials.","Jocen Bloch: The biggest obstacle are the authorities. So, one of those great results, you have to fill up about two kilograms of paper and form to run this kind of studies."
887,"BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.",BG: That's pretty much the brain is very devoid of etc.
888,"JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time  and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?","JB: Yeah, but it takes a long time to take a lot of patience and a very professional team."
889,"BG: If you project yourself --  having done the research  and having tried to get permission to start the trials,  if you project yourself out in time,  how many years before somebody gets into a hospital  and this therapy is available?","BG: Look into the future -- you've been making research and trying to get permission to the clinical trials going, and if you go on to the future, as many years it can come to the hospital, and that therapies will be available."
890,"JB: So, it's very difficult to say.",JB: That's hard to say.
891,"It depends, first, on the approval of the trial.","First of all, it depends on the random study of clinical trial."
892,Will the regulation allow us to do it soon?,"Will it allow us to start the listener, soon?"
893,"And then, you have to perform this kind of study  in a small group of patients.",Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.
894,"So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients,  do the treatment  and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.","It takes a long time to choose patients to get treatment, and to suggest whether it's useful to make that kind of treatment."
895,And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.,And then you have to apply that to a multi-touch study.
896,You have to really prove first that it's useful  before offering this treatment up for everybody.,You have to really prove first that it's useful before you can offer those treatment to everyone.
897,"BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.","BG: And that's safe, of course. JB: Of course."
898,"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.","BG: Jocene, thank you for coming to TED, and that you told us."
899,BG: Thank you.,BG: Thank you very much.
900,Democracy.,democracy.
901,"In the West,  we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.","We make a big mistake in the West, of course, as a sign of it."
902,"We see democracy  not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is,  but we see it as part of our society's furniture.","We see democracy as the fragile plant that is actually in reality, but as aInvent of our society."
903,We tend to think of it as an intransigent given.,We tend to think of them as a unthinkable thing.
904,We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.,We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.
905,It doesn't.,That's not true.
906,"Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing  that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism,  spectacular growth,  while politics remains democracy-free.","Lee Kuan Yewapur, and his great descendants in Peking have proven that it's possible to have a re-conservation of capitalism and amazing growth while the politics is completely unthinkable."
907,"Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods,  here in Europe.","In fact, democracy is a mess with us, in Europe."
908,"Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece --  the newly elected Greek government --  in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,  I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process --  our elections --  could not be allowed to interfere  with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.","At the beginning of the year when I was a Greek government -- the new Greek government was introduced to me as finance ministers in the European group, that the democratic processes of our country -- not our elections, who were re-engineered to the localstand-as."
909,"At that moment,  I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,  or the Chinese Communist Party,  indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me  that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.","And in that moment, I thought there would probably be no better rights for Lee Kuan Yew Yew, or the community-of-the-art side of China, or some of my friends saying democracy would make if they had anything to change."
910,"Tonight, here, I want to present to you  an economic case for an authentic democracy.","So, at this point, I want to introduce you to an economic model of a real democracy."
911,"I want to ask you to join me in believing again  that Lee Kuan Yew,  the Chinese Communist Party  and indeed the Eurogroup  are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy --  that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.","I'm going to ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew Yew, the communist Yew, China and even the European group of an Irian group, we might save democracy, but that we need a arrested and a highly ecstatic democracy."
912,"And without democracy,  our societies will be nastier,  our future bleak  and our great, new technologies wasted.","Because without democracy, our future will become more serious and more artificially using our great, new technologies."
913,"Speaking of waste,  allow me to point out an interesting paradox  that is threatening our economies as we speak.","So, to make a point of waste, I want to point out what is interesting is that we're threatened to see our economy."
914,I call it the twin peaks paradox.,I call it the twin twinsdox.
915,"One peak you understand --  you know it, you recognize it --  is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow  over the United States, Europe, the whole world.","A summit is known to you. You know him and see him as the shouldersenberg, the long shadow of his long shadows, Europe and all the world we face."
916,We all recognize the mountain of debts.,We all recognize the schoolenberg.
917,But few people discern its twin.,But very few people recognize their twins.
918,"A mountain of idle cash  belonging to rich savers and to corporations,  too terrified to invest it  into the productive activities that can generate the incomes  from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts  and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs,  like green energy.","A mountain of beekeepers that are eudatry that are enlightened the self-interests and corporate corporates, but it's a place where it would be productive and bringing income to the schools that could be wearing theenberg and also all the things that humanity need, for example, ""to-eudavation."""
919,Now let me give you two numbers.,I'll give you two numbers.
920,"Over the last three months,  in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone,  we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars  on all the wealth-producing goods --  things like industrial plants, machinery,  office blocks, schools,  roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.","In the last three months, in the U.S. and in England, 3.3 trillion dollars were invested together in U.S. and 3.3 trillion dollars, in all the wealth-dollar goods, like industrialized, machines, bureaucrats, streets, green, and so on and so forth."
921,"$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money  until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion  that has been slushing around in the same countries,  in our financial institutions,  doing absolutely nothing during the same period  except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.","3.3 trillion dollars sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it to the  5, trillion dollars to the same countries around the world and around the same countries, and absolutely nothing, except for the stock market prices to move up."
922,"So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash  form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets.","So, schools and unabounded capital that twins don't form through the usual market mechanical mechanisms."
923,"The result is stagnant wages,  more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe  And consequently, low aggregate demand,  which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors,  who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing --  exactly like Oedipus' father,  who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle  that his son would grow up to kill him,","The result is stagnation, more than a quarter of the 25-year-olds in the U.S. and Europe workless, and followed a low-level demand for the pesimistic demand that went to be low-income, a low-cost demand for the investors that they do, that even though they don't invest, the saymbiotically-eky father that might be true, if he's growing his son,"
924,"unwittingly engineered the conditions  that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.",ungewks the circumstances that lead to that depleted thedipus kills him.
925,This is my quarrel with capitalism.,This is my Hader with capitalism.
926,"Its gross wastefulness,  all this idle cash,  should be energized to improve lives,  to develop human talents,  and indeed to finance all these technologies,  green technologies,  which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.","And it's a very important way to make it happen, all of this unreviewed capital should be used to improve our lives, to make human talents, and especially the technology that is to fund green technology that is critical for the Earth."
927,Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?,"So, democracy is the solution?"
928,"I believe so,  but before we move on,  what do we mean by democracy?","I think before we continue, what do we understand about democracy?"
929,"Aristotle defined democracy  as the constitution in which the free and the poor,  being in the majority, control government.","Aristotle defined democracy as a society, where the open and the poor are control the government as a majority."
930,"Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.","The Indian democracy decided that, of course, decided to make a lot of them."
931,"Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves.","Women, foreign, and of course slavery."
932,But it would be a mistake  to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy  on the basis of whom it excluded.,But it would be a mistake to vision the places of the straight democracy because of these extinct.
933,"What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy,  was the inclusion of the working poor,  who not only acquired the right to free speech,  but more importantly, crucially,  they acquired the rights to political judgments  that were afforded equal weight  in the decision-making concerning matters of state.","The key thing about the breathe democracy was that they were working poor, and not only did they get the right to them, but more important, and they decide what to give them the right to political compassion with the same balance as the state of state."
934,"Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.",The Indian democracy has not been given long.
935,"Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.","As a candle that's very bright, it's also embracing fast."
936,"And indeed,  our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.",But our liberal crammeds don't have our roots in anti-nepne.
937,"They have their roots in the Magna Carta,  in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,  indeed in the American constitution.","It's in Magna Carte, where 1688 revolutions, even in the American history."
938,"Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen  and empowering the working poor,  our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition,  which was, after all, a charter for masters.","As the breathe democracy focuses on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy based on the values of the Magna Carte, the last set was a sentence for Mr."
939,"And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible  to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere,  so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere,  leaving the economic sphere --  the corporate world, if you want --  as a democracy-free zone.","Because liberal democracy came only when a complete sphere of politics and economic processes could be limited to politics, as the economy became limited, so the world of corporate policies became."
940,"Now, in our democracies today,  this separation of the economic from the political sphere,  it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two,  with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power.","In our ancestors since then, the separation of policy and economics started, an unsustainable struggle between the two is being able to promote the economy and the policy that they've been underlying."
941,Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?,Do you remember why the politicians aren't as early as they used to?
942,It's not because their DNA has degenerated.,It's not because of a generation a DNA.
943,"It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power,  because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere,  which is separate.","It's because you can be in government today and yet not in power, because the power of politics is causing the economy and the areas separated."
944,I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.,I mentioned my Hader with capitalism.
945,"If you think about it,  it is a little bit like a population of predators,  that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on,  that in the end they starve.","When you think about it, it's sort of like a herding of predators that are so sustainable that the animals they feed off, that it remained so remained."
946,"Similarly,  the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere  to such an extent that it is undermining itself,  Corporate power is increasing,  political goods are devaluing,  inequality is rising,  aggregate demand is falling  and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.","Similarly, it's similar to the economy that has so far in politics that it can self-replicating the economic crisis itself, the power of the corporate goods, political goods that falls inability to provide economic demand and leaders of business to invest their companies."
947,"So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy,  the taller the twin peaks  and the greater the waste of human resources  and humanity's wealth.","The more successful of capitalism is a ""Deingence"": the people from democracy, the higher the twins, and the greater waste of human labor and prosperity of humanity."
948,"Clearly, if this is right,  we must reunite the political and economic spheres  and better do it with a demos being in control,  like in ancient Athens except without the slaves  or the exclusion of women and migrants.","If that's obvious, it's obvious that we need to bring the policy and the economy together, and it would be better if the atmosphere is in control, such as the ancient Athens, if it's in the ancient appreciating the slaves and the women and the foreigner."
949,"Now, this is not an original idea.","This is not a new idea, by the way."
950,"The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago  and it didn't go very well, did it?","The maristic left was this idea 100 years ago, and it didn't really work well."
951,"The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle  is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered,  as they were in ancient Athens,  without creating new forms of brutality and waste.","The teaching from the Soviet Union should be that the working poor should only be able to create a miracle of ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of grossity and waste waste."
952,But there is a solution:  eliminate the working poor.,But there's a solution: the poor are creating.
953,"Capitalism's doing it  by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.",capitalism does it by replaced reward by automation and robots.
954,"The problem is  that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate,  automation makes the twin peaks taller,  the waste loftier  and the social conflicts deeper,  including -- soon, I believe --  in places like China.","The problem is that the problem with economics and politics are separated, the largely the twins of twins, the social conflict, the social conflict, the way it's very, very soon -- as I believe in countries, are coming in."
955,"So we need to reconfigure,  we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres,  but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere,  lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy  that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.","So we need to re-construct the economy and the policy-plays, and to look at the same time, that we end up democratized the democratic spaces, otherwise we end up in a sick car, which makes movies like a sexx."
956,So the question is not whether capitalism will survive  the technological innovations it is spawning.,"So the question is not whether capitalism has brought together, which is being re-intentioned, is a life-in-law."
957,"The more interesting question  is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia  or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society,  where machines serve the humans  and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe  and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life  in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.","The interesting question is whether capitalism is done by a Dystopie, similar to what's going to be the ""Matrix,"" or by something that will serve the community into ""Star Trek,"" in which people serve their energy in the universe, or their energy of exploration, or in a high-tech way of anti-tech Agora,"" in long-dorative atheists, are talking about the meaning of life."
958,I think we can afford to be optimistic.,I think we can be optimistic.
959,"But what would it take, what would it look like  to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?","So what could it look like, this ""Star Trek""-like Utopia instead of having ""Matrix sex"" thing?"
960,"In practical terms,  allow me to share just briefly,  a couple of examples.",I want to show you a few examples of all the sound I'm going to call.
961,"At the level of the enterprise,  imagine a capital market,  where you earn capital as you work,  and where your capital follows you from one job to another,  from one company to another,  and the company --  whichever one you happen to work at at that time --  is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.","In the area of businesses, imagine if you're making a capital market, where you're working as you work and you work in your capital from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're working in -- property of the company that's working in the company."
962,"Then all income stems from capital, from profits,  and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.",Then all the incomes go out of capital and cause the concept of the work is completely shaped.
963,"No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company  and those who work but do not own the company;  no more tug-of-war between capital and labor;  no great gap between investment and saving;  indeed, no towering twin peaks.","No more humble between those who are in the businesses, but they don't work there, and the employees that work there, but don't hear about the company, no longer between capital and work, no big gaps between investment and Spart, and ultimately, no empathic twins."
964,"At the level of the global political economy,  imagine for a moment  that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate,  with a universal, global, digital currency,  one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund,  on behalf of all humanity.","In the global political economics, imagine that our national dignity would have a free-time transition, in a universal, global currency, digital currency that are given by the IMF and the G-20 [unclear], the 20-like world's interest in all humankind."
965,"And imagine further  that all international trade is denominated in this currency --  let's call it ""the cosmos,""  in units of cosmos --  with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund  a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit,  or indeed to a country's trade surplus.","Imagine that the whole world will act in this currency -- we call it ""in Kosmos,"" in units of ""Cosmos,"" and any government pay the sum of the trade or the trade of the country has gotten a shared fund."
966,"And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies,  especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.","Imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are legal."
967,This is not a new idea.,This is not a new idea.
968,"It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed  in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.",It's basically what John Maynard Keynes had put in the board of a board of a state.
969,"The problem is  that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.",The problem was that you didn't have the technical means of doing it at the time.
970,"Now we do,  especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.","Today we have them, particularly in the background of a resemblance and economics."
971,"The world that I am describing to you  is simultaneously libertarian,  in that it prioritizes empowered individuals,  Marxist,  since it will have confined to the dustbin of history  the division between capital and labor,  and Keynesian,  global Keynesian.","The world that I'm talking about to you is liberated at the same time in which it privileged people to prefer privileged and maristic, because it's buried by capital and work in the mothers of history, and key siansian, global key."
972,"But above all else,  it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.","But, above all, it's a world where we can imagine a real democracy."
973,Will such a world dawn?,We're in such a world.
974,Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?,"Are we going to hide in a ""Matrix"" shamcy clogged?"
975,The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.,The answer depends on how we decide politically.
976,"It is our choice,  and we'd better make it democratically.","It's in our hands, and we do better."
977,Thank you.,Thank you.
978,Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...,Bruno Giussani: Yanis...
979,It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.,You write yourself in your biology itself as libertarianists.
980,What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?,How relevant is Marx' analysis today?
981,"Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said,  then Marx is relevant.","So, in Varoufakis: If anything I've just said about what's relevant, then Marx relevant."
982,"Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is --  if we don't do it,  then technological innovation is going to create  such a massive fall in aggregate demand,  what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.","The reason why we do this re-inventing of politics and economics is that we don't do that, that will create a massive, massive-level development of the demand, which is called Larry Summers as the chief day."
983,"With this crisis migrating from one part of the world,  as it is now,  it will destabilize not only our democracies,  but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.","Through the transmission of one part of the Earth at the next, how we're seeing it, it's not just our democracy, but also the countries that are devoted to liberal democracy."
984,"So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.",If this analysis is a Marx if you're able to meet.
985,"But so is Hayek,  that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,  and so is Keynes,  so that's why I'm totally confused.","And as Hayek, so I'm a liberating Marxist, and as Keynes, and so I'm totally us."
986,"BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.","BG: In fact, now we're also."
987,"YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?","YV: If you're not more, you don't think enough."
988,"BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say --  YV: That was Einstein, actually --  BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China,  and last night at the speaker dinner,  you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China.","BG: This is a very Greek, sort of a philosophical explanation -- YV: It was actually Einstein who said that. BG: In your talk, your talk, your talk, and China, and yesterday, I think, you know, you've been very clear at dinner, what you're saying to the point of view of the West."
989,Would you like to share that?,Do you want to repeat it here?
990,"YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.",YV: There's a big measure of yeast.
991,"In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.",In our liberal democracy we have the apparently of democracy.
992,"It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk,  democracy to the political sphere,  while leaving the one sphere where all the action is --  the economic sphere --  a completely democracy-free zone.","As I said in my talk, we have democracy in politics, as the realm of where most of the time is a game of economics -- the realm of economics -- a completely democratic zone."
993,"In a sense,  if I am allowed to be provocative,  China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.","In a way, if I can say this as I'm concerned, China is feeding the 19th century China today."
994,"Because remember,  we tend to associate liberalism with democracy --  that's a mistake, historically.","Because remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, it's a percentage."
995,"Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.","In liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart mill."
996,John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.,He was particularly skeptical about what the democratic development was.
997,"So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process  to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution,  especially the transition from the first to the second.","Now, what you can see in China is very similar to the development that we've had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the first to the second."
998,"And to be castigating China  for doing that which the West did in the 19th century,  smacks of hypocrisy.","China now to throw what the West itself has done in the 19th century, smell of a violent sphere."
999,BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience  as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.,BG: I'm sure many audiences are curious to your experience as finance ministers are beginning from the beginning of the year.

1004,"Not just Greece, the Eurozone.","Not just Greek land, but the European zone."
1005,"To move away from the complacency  and the constant denial that there was a massive --  and there is a massive architectural fault line  going through the Eurozone,  which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.","Because we're getting ourselves from self-esteem to self-organization, and the limitations that a massive resemblance of the European zone, and still growing the development of the entire Union."
1006,We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program --  was the first program to manifest that denial --  to put it right.,"We had the opportunity to find the basis of Greek proposal -- the first proposal, which was the effort to be able to do."

1055,"So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here,  the bulge of average TV,  you know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad,  they don't really get you excited.","He's making more thoughts about the middle pillars, the average television -- the show, neither good, they're not bad, they're not."
1056,So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this.,So he has to make sure that he's really at the right side.
1057,"So the pressure is on, and of course it's also the first time  that Amazon is even doing something like this,  so Roy Price does not want to take any chances.","The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy crash doesn't want to risk."
1058,He wants to engineer success.,He wants to create success.
1059,"He needs a guaranteed success,  and so what he does is, he holds a competition.","He needs the global success, so he thinks it's going to take a competition."
1060,"So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,  and from those ideas, through an evaluation,  they select eight candidates for TV shows,  and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows  and puts them online for free for everyone to watch.","He takes lots of ideas for TV show, and then he takes an eight-hour show from TV show, then he produces the first person on each of these show, and he's making them online where everybody can look for free."
1061,"And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff, you're going to take it, right?","And if Amazon gives free things to be done, you're going to go right?"
1062,So millions of viewers are watching those episodes.,Millions of audience look at these features.
1063,"What they don't realize is that, while they're watching their shows,  actually, they are being watched.","But they don't know that when they look at this show, they're watching this show."
1064,"They are being watched by Roy Price and his team,  who record everything.",They're going to be watching Roy and his team who are buried everything.
1065,"They record when somebody presses play, when somebody presses pause,  what parts they skip, what parts they watch again.","It's when you pick up the show, when you're putting paus on what pieces you're going to be looking at again."
1066,"So they collect millions of data points,  because they want to have those data points  to then decide which show they should make.","They collect millions of data, and then deciding what show should be producing."
1067,"And sure enough, so they collect all the data,  they do all the data crunching, and an answer emerges,  and the answer is,  ""Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators.""","In fact, they collect the data, and it gives the answer, and it says, ""Amazon to a Sitcoma over four-month U.S.ator."""
1068,They did that show.,They did this show.
1069,So does anyone know the name of the show?,Anybody name the name of this show?
1070,"Yes, ""Alpha House,""  but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually,  because it didn't turn out that great.","Yes, ""urha House,"" but it seems that a lot of these shows cannot remember this show because it wasn't so good."
1071,"It's actually just an average show,  actually -- literally, in fact, because the average of this curve here is at 7.4,  and ""Alpha House"" lands at 7.5,  so a slightly above average show,  but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for.","It's just an average show -- in the word, that's the average of the curve, and the alpha of these curves are landed on 12 -- so something that's on average, but not what Roy and his team came up."
1072,"Meanwhile, however, at about the same time,  at another company,  another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis,  and his name is Ted,  Ted Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix,  and just like Roy, he's on a constant mission  to find that great TV show,  and he uses data as well to do that,  except he does it a little bit differently.","Something at the same time, another manager has taken a top-down show by data analysis, Ted Sarandos, who's managers for Netflix's programmers, who's been looking at Netflix and he's using this super-how to find data on it, but he does something different."
1073,"So instead of holding a competition, what he did -- and his team of course --  was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers,  you know, the ratings they give their shows,  the viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on.","Instead of making a competition, they have a team and his team have been looking at the Netflix data on the Netflix scale, so the score that they give the show, the show that they like."
1074,"And then they use that data to discover  all of these little bits and pieces about the audience:  what kinds of shows they like,  what kind of producers, what kind of actors.","Then they use this data to try and figure out these little details about the audience: what show you like, what producers, what actors."
1075,"And once they had all of these pieces together,  they took a leap of faith,  and they decided to license  not a sitcom about four Senators  but a drama series about a single Senator.","When they had all these pieces, they went to an orphanage, and decided not to do a Sitcoma, but to make a drama series on a Senator."
1076,You guys know the show?,You know the show?
1077,"Yes, ""House of Cards,"" and Netflix of course, nailed it with that show,  at least for the first two seasons.","Yes, ""House of the graduated."" Netflix did a heat, at least for the first two season."
1078,"""House of Cards"" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve,  so it's exactly where they wanted it to be.","""hope of Cards"" is going to get a 9,1-dollar level on this curve, so exactly where they wanted to go."
1079,"Now, the question of course is, what happened here?","Now, of course, the question is: what happened here?"
1080,"So you have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.","You've got two very weird data, data-of-the-box companies."
1081,"They connect all of these millions of data points,  and then it works beautifully for one of them,  and it doesn't work for the other one.","They connect this many data together, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."
1082,So why?,What is that?
1083,Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time.,Because the logic somehow says that it should work on everything.
1084,"I mean, if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make,  then you should be able to make a pretty good decision.","If you collect millions of data, for a decision you're supposed to make, you should make a good decision."
1085,You have 200 years of statistics to rely on.,You've got 200 years of statistics than Back people.
1086,You're amplifying it with very powerful computers.,You optimize it through very powerful computers.
1087,"The least you could expect is good TV, right?","The minimum, what you're looking for is good television, right?"
1088,"And if data analysis does not work that way,  then it actually gets a little scary,  because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more  to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV.","If data doesn't work, it's a little bit scary, because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions, way beyond television."
1089,Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?,Anybody here does the multi-Health system?
1090,"No one. OK, that's good actually.","Nobody. OK, that's actually good."
1091,"OK, so Multi-Health Systems is a software company,  and I hope that nobody here in this room  ever comes into contact with that software,  because if you do, it means you're in prison.","MultiHealth system is a software company, and I hope nobody in this room ever comes with that software. Come with it, you're in jail."
1092,"If someone here in the US is in prison, and they apply for parole,  then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company  will be used in determining whether to grant that parole.","If someone in the United States is in jail, and please ask for free, it's probably that data analysis is going to use this company to determine whether a free-off or not."
1093,"So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix,  but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad,  you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad.","Just like Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding whether a show is going to be good or bad, whether a person is going to be good or bad."
1094,"And mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be pretty bad,  but more years in prison, I guess, even worse.","Middle TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years's prisons."
1095,"And unfortunately, there is actually some evidence that this data analysis,  despite having lots of data, does not always produce optimum results.","Unfortunately, there's evidence that this data analysis despite the many data."
1096,And that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems  doesn't know what to do with data.,"Not always the best results, and that's because a multi-Health system doesn't know how to use data."
1097,Even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong.,"And again, the most hidden companies are wrong."
1098,"Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.","Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes."
1099,"In 2009, Google announced that they were able, with data analysis,  to predict outbreaks of influenza, the nasty kind of flu,  by doing data analysis on their Google searches.","In 2009, Google had known that it was based on data analysis by flu, the bad species, by able to predict data analysis of Google analysis."
1100,"And it worked beautifully, and it made a big splash in the news,  including the pinnacle of scientific success: a publication in the journal ""Nature.""","It worked wonderful and was a big news. The success in a publication in the magazine called ""nature."""
1101,"It worked beautifully for year after year after year,  until one year it failed.",It worked a liberate year around year until it didn't work.
1102,And nobody could even tell exactly why.,And nobody could say why.
1103,"It just didn't work that year, and of course that again made big news,  of a publication from the journal ""Nature.""","It didn't work simple, this was again again a mustard, including the Widerruf of the Sun in the magazine."
1104,"So even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google,  they sometimes get it wrong.",Even the most hidden companies like Amazon and Google are enlightened sometimes a little bit.
1105,"And despite all those failures,  data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making --  into the workplace,  law enforcement,  medicine.","Despite looking at all these mistakes in decisions about the life of life -- at the workplace, at the legal side, in medicine."
1106,So we should better make sure that data is helping.,So we'd better hire that data is helpful.
1107,"Now, personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself,  because I work in computational genetics,  which is also a field where lots of very smart people  are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions  like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug.",I also know a lot of trouble with data. I work in computer genetics -- an area where some very smart people use a lot of data to make serious decisions about how the decision for cancer therapy.
1108,"And over the years, I've noticed a sort of pattern  or kind of rule, if you will, about the difference  between successful decision-making with data  and unsuccessful decision-making,  and I find this a pattern worth sharing, and it goes something like this.","Or the evolution of a medicine, over the years, I've seen some patterns in between successful decisions about data and not by successful decisions, and the pattern should be spread."
1109,"So whenever you're solving a complex problem,  you're doing essentially two things.","Do you ever solve a complex problem, you're mainly doing two things."
1110,"The first one is, you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces  so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces,  You put all of these bits and pieces back together again  to come to your conclusion.","The first thing is, you put this problem in the parts of the parts, so you can analyze the pieces, and then you put the pieces back together to get the pieces back together to make a point."
1111,"And sometimes you have to do it over again,  but it's always those two things:  taking apart and putting back together again.","Sometimes you have to do this more, but it's always two things: take apart and put them together again."
1112,And now the crucial thing is  that data and data analysis is only good for the first part.,And now the most important thing: data and data analysis is just good for the first part.
1113,"Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful,  can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces.","data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to get a problem and understand his parts."
1114,It's not suited to put those pieces back together again  and then to come to a conclusion.,They're not able to put together the pieces back together and then get a point.
1115,"There's another tool that can do that, and we all have it, and that tool is the brain.","And there's another tool for that, and we own it all: our brains."
1116,"If there's one thing a brain is good at,  it's taking bits and pieces back together again,  even when you have incomplete information,  and coming to a good conclusion,  especially if it's the brain of an expert.","If there's something that is good to put together, it's pieces and pieces again, even if the information is unimaginable, to capture a good sign -- especially when the brain is an expert."
1117,"And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful,  because they used data and brains where they belong in the process.","That's why I think Netflix was so successful, because they used data and mind, where they're also using in the process."
1118,"They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience  that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth,  but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces  and put them back together again and make a show like ""House of Cards,""  that was nowhere in the data.","They use data to understand their audience better than ever, but the decision that they would have been able to do is put all these pieces together, put a show back together, and make a show like, ""hope of often,"" that didn't stand in the data."
1119,"Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show,  which also meant, by the way, that they were taking  a pretty big personal risk with that decision.",Ted Sarandososo and his team made these decisions for what it meant was that they made a major personal risk to get at risk.
1120,"And Amazon, on the other hand, they did it the wrong way around.",Amazon did it in the wrong way.
1121,"They used data all the way to drive their decision-making,  first when they held their competition of TV ideas,  then when they selected ""Alpha House"" to make as a show.","They used data to control all their decisions first as they're going to be on TV books, and then they'd be called theAlpha House."
1122,"Which of course was a very safe decision for them,  because they could always point at the data, saying,  ""This is what the data tells us.""","It was a safe decision because they could always say, ""That's what the data is."""
1123,But it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for.,It didn't lead to the very best thing.
1124,"So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions,  but I believe that things go wrong  when data is starting to drive those decisions.","data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are wrong when data is starting to control our decisions."
1125,"No matter how powerful, data is just a tool,  and to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful.","It doesn't matter how powerful it is, data is just a tool, and to forget that, it's pretty useful."
1126,Many of you will ...,Thank you very much.
1127,"Before there was data,  this was the decision-making device to use.","Before that data, it was the device for decisions."
1128,Many of you will know this.,Many of them know it.
1129,"This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball,  and it's really amazing,  because if you have a decision to make, a yes or no question,  all you have to do is you shake the ball, and then you get an answer --  ""Most Likely"" -- right here in this window in real time.","It's also called theMag 8 Balls. It's amazing for decisions or no-in-Futlut, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. ""Has probably"" -- right here in that moment."
1130,I'll have it out later for tech demos.,I'm going to do it later with a technique.
1131,"Now, the thing is, of course -- so I've made some decisions in my life  where, in hindsight, I should have just listened to the ball.",I've met some decisions in my life where I should have heard in the ball.
1132,"But, you know, of course, if you have the data available,  you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated,  like data analysis to come to a better decision.","But, of course, you know, if you have the data available, you want to replace it through something much more exaggeration, like data analysis to make better decisions."
1133,But that does not change the basic setup.,But that doesn't change the cause.
1134,"So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter,  but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions  if we want to achieve something extraordinary, on the right end of the curve.","So maybe the ball will smarter and smarter and smarter, and eventually it's because we make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the curve."
1135,"And I find that a very encouraging message, in fact,  that even in the face of huge amounts of data,  it still pays off to make decisions,  to be an expert in what you're doing  and take risks.","And I feel this as a very encouraging message that it still gets paid a lot of data, to make decisions about what to do and to go to risks."
1136,"Because in the end, it's not data,  it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve.","Because at the end of it, it's not the data, but the risks that you end up with at the right end of the curve."
1137,Thank you.,Thank you.
